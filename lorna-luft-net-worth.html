Lorna is a Primetime Emmy Award-nominated actress who has made over 20 stage appearances. Her career started in 1963.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Lorna Luft is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Luft’s net worth is as high as $500,000, an amount earned through her acting and singing career. In addition to appearing on stage, Luft has also worked on television and played in feature films, which has improved her wealth.</p><h3>Lorna Luft Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Lorna Luft grew up in California and went to the University High School in Los Angeles, where she was a member of a school choir. Together with siblings<a href=#> Liza Minnelli </a>and Joey Luft, Lorna sang “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” on her mother’s CBS television series “The Judy Garland Show” in 1963. Soon after, Luft appeared in the musical “I Could Go on Singing” (1963) starring her mother and Dirk Bogarde, but waited ten years for her next television project.</p><p>In the meantime, Lorna debuted on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre as a replacement cast member in the musical “Promises, Promises” in 1971. The same year she played in Sandy Wilson’s musical “The Boy Friend”, and then had a minor role in the TV series “Love, American Style” in 1973. Two years later, Luft played in an episode of “McCloud”, then put her career on hold for five years before returning to the stage in “Grease” (1980) and “Carnival!” (1980). In the early ‘80s, Lorna appeared in several plays including “They’re Playing Our Song” (1981), “Snoopy! The Musical” (1983) and “Extremities” (1983), while she also had a part in “Grease 2” (1984) with <a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a> and <a href=#>Maxwell Caulfield</a>, increasing her net worth considerably.</p><p>In 1985, Lorna appeared in an episode of “The Twilight Zone”, and then in “Tales from the Darkside” in 1986, then played Nurse Libby Kegler in 19 episodes of “Trapper John, M.D.” from 1985 to 1986. She ended the decade in such musicals as “Little Shop of Horrors” (1986), “Mame” (1986), “The Unsinkable Molly Brown”, and “Girl Crazy” (1988). Her career took a step back in the ’90 as she decided to take another break, however, Luft still worked in such movies as “My Giant” (1998) alongside <a href=#>Billy Crystal</a>,<a href=#> Kathleen Quinlan</a>, and Gheorghe Muresan, and in “54” (1998) with<a href=#> Ryan Phillippe</a>, <a href=#>Salma Hayek</a>, <a href=#>Mike Myers</a>, and <a href=#>Neve Campbell</a>. Lorna also had roles in such plays as “Guys and Dolls” (1992) and “Follies” (1996).</p><p>Luft almost entirely neglected her on-screen career for the theatre in the 2000s, as she played in numerous musicals including “Gypsy” (2002), “White Christmas” (2006), “The Wizard of Oz” (2008), and “Hello, Dolly!” (2012). Most recently, Luft appeared in an episode of “Sean Saves the World” (2014) starring <a href=#>Sean Hayes</a>. Her net worth was steady.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Lorna Luft was married to Jake Hooker from 1977 to 1993 and has two children with him. She has been married to <a href=#>Colin Freeman</a> since 1996. In January 2013, Loft was diagnosed with grade-2A breast cancer. Following chemotherapy and radiation, Lorna decided to undergo a lumpectomy to save her breast; however, cancer re-emerged in June 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.432278481013><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lorna Luft</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 21, 1952</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Monica, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 4" (1.63 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>HB Studio</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Colin Freeman (m. 1996), Jake Hooker (m. 1977–1993)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Vanessa Hooker, Jesse Hooker</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Sidney Luft, Judy Garland</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Siblings</td><td>Liza Minnelli, Joey Luft, John Luft, Andrew Luft</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/LornaLuftOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005167/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lorna-luft-mn0000830067</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows, My Giant, Where the Boys Are '84, Grease 2, Judy Garland: The Concert Years</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World, Trapper John, M.D.</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=9.0334821428571><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5.4159292035398><td>1</td><td>As far as I know, the only gay member of my family was <a href=#>Peter Allen</a>, my beloved brother-in-law, who died of AIDS.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Although I loved Liza as a little girl, it would be true to say I really didn't know her.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>A star needs all the rest she can get.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>A gay man has no business leading on a heterosexual woman.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>A career is all very well, but no one lives by work alone.</td></tr><tr readability=2.5975609756098><td>6</td><td>Of the three, Lorna is the one that inherited Judy's musical talent". <a href=#>Roger Edens</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=38.326109570042><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>Performs "Songs My Mother Taught Me" at the Winnipeg Centennial Concert Hall, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
