This comes only months after Leah made headlines for being slapped with a $489,000. In total, the former teen mother now owes over $779,000 in federal and state taxes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle Have Reportedly Hired Divorce Lawyers</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the reality star has had money troubles for years. It was first reported that she owed back due taxes in November 2020. At the time, she had a lien of $155,000, which has now grown to nearly a million-dollar debt.</p><p>The unpaid taxes for back nearly a decade, with the first debts being incurred in 2015.</p><p>In 2019, Leah discussed her financial situation on her co-star Kailyn Lowry’s Coffee Convos podcast. The mother-of-three admitted to having a history of giving money to friends and family, despite negative repercussions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I always want people to know I’m still that humble person and I felt [that] giving to everyone, I would get in return … but in the end it still hurt me,” <a href=#>she said at the time</a>.</p><p>“It hurt me, like, it caused one of my divorces, with Jeremy [Calvert], because I would be giving to everyone,” Leah continued. “I gave my dad $40,000, just to keep my dad around.”</p><p>Leah’s financial situation was further exposed last year on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, when she bought a house with her then-fiancé, Jaylan Mobley. Even though she paid for the house, only Jaylan’s name was added to the deed, presumably because Leah’s tax situation would make it difficult to secure a mortgage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple broke up shortly after, though Leah has continued to live in the home despite not being listed on the deed.</p><p>So far, Leah hasn’t commented on recent reports of her newest tax lien.</p><p>Leah isn’t the only Teen Mom star to face tax trouble. As of August 2022, Tyler Baltierra and Catelynn Lowell (who are also original cast members) reportedly still owe over $300,000 in federal and state taxes.</p><p>In 2021, the former teen parents were previously hit with a lien worth over $500,000 over unpaid taxes for the years 2016 and 2017. The reality stars are reportedly still paying the debt off.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s Makeup Brand In Trouble After Evidence Of ‘Unsanitary’ Conditions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>The Ashley</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBprHNZqSopV2owaK%2BjKWcmqBdorK0v8SrZKivlah6r7HAq6OyZWFiuqq4y6Kmp2WZo3q2us%2BaoJ1lpJbFpr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-check-bece-results.html><span>←</span><span>How To Check BECE Results</span></a>
