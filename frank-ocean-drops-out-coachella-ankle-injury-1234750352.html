According to a statement from the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=598289>blond</a> artist’s reps, the reason for the cancelation is because of an apparent <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234723789>sustained injury.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“After suffering an <a href=# id=auto-tag_injury data-tag=injury>injury</a> to his leg on festival grounds in the week leading up to weekend 1,&nbsp;Frank Ocean&nbsp;was unable to perform the<a href=#> intended show</a> but was still intent on performing, and in 72 hours, the show was reworked out of necessity.

There is some beauty in chaos. It isn’t what I intended to show but I did enjoy being out there and I’ll see you soon.” He will be replaced by Blink-182.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>Billboard</a> reported that the Channel Orange singer began his set nearly an hour after it was initially scheduled. It was described as “deceptively intimate” with him performing a total of 20 songs over the course of 90 minutes, including new versions of hits like “Chanel,” “Pink + White,” and more. This moment ended his seven-year performance hiatus. Ocean also <a href=#>dedicated his show</a> to his late brother, Ryan Breaux, who died at age 18 in 2020 during a car accident.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s been so long…. But I have missed you. You know, these last couple years, my life changed so much…. My brother and I, we came to this festival a lot,” the crooner stated to the crowd.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Continuing, “…One of my <a href=#>fondest memories</a> was watching&nbsp;Rae Sremmurd&nbsp;on I don’t know what that stage is called with my brother. And Travis [Bennett], I don’t know if Travis/Taco is here, but we was just dancing in that tent to their music, and I know he would’ve been so excited to be here with all of us. I want to say thank you for the support and the ears and the love over all this time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in December 2022, Ocean spoke on his grief in a special episode of blonded radio and <a href=#>teased new music</a>.
