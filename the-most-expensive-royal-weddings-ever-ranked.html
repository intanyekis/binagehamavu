BBC News stated on May 6, 1960, the royal wedding was the first to be televised. The groom wasn't poor. Their ceremony was not meek. It was huge. Express reported that the wedding cost $40,000. Inflation would make the number about $212,000 today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prince-rainier-iii-and-grace-kelly---2-million>Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly - $2 Million</h2><p>Monaco hosted a lavish royal wedding for an American "commoner" in 1956. On April 18, 1956, Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier III. The <a href=#>princess and prince of Monaco</a> in St. Nicholas Church in Monaco. Before marrying the prince, her father, millionaire Jack Kelly, had to offer a $2 million dowry. "My daughter doesn't have to pay any man to marry her," her furious father told Express. He contributed $2 million to wedding costs. Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly's wedding was simply extravagant.</p><h2 id=crown-princess-victoria-and-daniel-westling---2-63-million>Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling - $2.63 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crown Princess Victoria married Daniel Westling in 2010. The Telegraph stated that the celebrations will extend for many days. Almost 5 million viewers watched the couple's wedding. 200,000 people visited the city to see the bride and groom. A month before the royal wedding, Sweden's The Local estimated the cost at 20 million kronor, or $2.63 million. Swedish royal treasurer Jan Lindman said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 million kronor</a> would come "from the government" taxpayers and "the remainder" would be the king's responsibility. "Guests need food, beverages, and entertainment. Rearrange the palace furniture and clean the old hall," he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Royal Fleet: A Peek Inside The Late Queen Elizabeth II's Luxury Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=princess-eugenie-and-jack-brooksbank---3-3-million>Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank - $3.3 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Princess Eugenie married longtime partner Jack Brooksbank after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle's George's Chapel. In an Express interview, Bridebook creator Hamish Shephard estimated the princess' wedding cost. Hamish estimates the royal wedding cost $3.3 million, including caterers, flowers, entertainment, and police presence. Harper's Bazaar claimed that <a href=#>princess Eugenie</a>'s bridal gown alone cost the royal family $135,000 and that's low. "It's probable that her gown is being produced exclusively for her, and that fabrics were acquired wherever necessary," the journal said.</p><h2 id=prince-pavlos-of-greece-and-marie-chantal-miller---8-million>Prince Pavlos of Greece and Marie-Chantal Miller - $8 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Compared to Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece and Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding, a few million dollars is nothing. The pair married in 1995 at St. Sophia's Church in London, despite not being royal. Miller donned a "pearl-encrusted Valentino gown" with a 13-foot Chantilly lace train, which took 25 seamstresses four months to make, according to Vogue. The late florist and event planner Robert Isabell built "a Greek temple and garden" for the royal wedding, according to a 1996 New York Times article. The prince's parents' wedding cost $8 million, the outlet stated.</p><h2 id=prince-william-and-kate-middleton---34-million>Prince William and Kate Middleton - $34 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Prince William and Kate Middleton</a>’s royal wedding was expensive. Their 2011 wedding cost £23.7 million (about $34 million), according to Business Insider. CBS News said that security cost all but $2 million. Kate's $434,000 Alexander McQueen gown cost most of the spare money. Kate's family reportedly helped pay for the couple's wedding, even though the British royal family usually does. According to Vanity Fair, the Middleton family contributed a "six-figure gift" to the couple's wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prince-harry-and-meghan-markle---42-8-million>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - $42.8 Million</h2><p>May 2018's royal wedding cost a lot. It cost more than William and Kate's wedding. Bridebook, a wedding planning service, estimated that the couple's wedding would cost "almost 100 times" the average U.K. wedding, not including "£30 million planned security expenditures." The couple's wedding cost $42.8 million. St. George's Chapel at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windsor Castle</a> was the most expensive location after security. "As was the case with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Royal Family will pay for the fundamental parts of the wedding, such as the church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations, and the reception afterward," Harry's communications secretary said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Outfits Worn By Meghan Markle, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=prince-albert-ii-and-charlene-wittstock---70-million>Prince Albert II and Charlene Wittstock - $70 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, <a href=#>Monaco's Prince Albert II</a> married Charlene Wittstock. "It was a much-needed sprinkling of stardust for the Grimaldi family, harking back to the happy day, 55 years ago, when Albert's late father, Prince Rainier, married Hollywood beauty Grace Kelly," the Los Angeles Times said. Like Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly's royal wedding, the modern couple's wedding was extravagant. According to the publication, the wedding costs tallied up to $70 million. Rumors overshadowed the wedding's grandeur. Some said Wittstock had cold feet and would cancel. However, they married and are still together.</p><h2 id=prince-charles-and-lady-diana-spencer---110-million>Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer - $110 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The royal couple's 1981 wedding was the most expensive British royal wedding ever. According to Business Insider, the wedding may have cost $110 million after inflation, making it roughly four times more expensive than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding. <a href=#>Lady Diana</a>'s wedding gown cost six figures. For various reasons, Town & Country valued her outfit at $115,000. Diana's veil was longer than her wedding dress's 25-foot train. This wedding became the "wedding of the century" due to the high cost of the venue, décor, and flowers.</p><h2 id=sheikh-mohammed-bin-zayed-al-nahyan-and-princess-salama---100-million>Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Princess Salama - $100 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Rarest, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi and Princess Salama of the United Arab Emirates enjoyed one of the most extravagant weddings ever in 1981. By today's standards, it would have cost over $100 million — more than <a href=#>Prince Charles</a> and Princess Diana's 1981 wedding. The sheik's parents erected a 20,000-seat stadium for the occasion, Forbes said. The sheik celebrated with his citizens in every town in the emirate for a week on horseback. This is the most lavish wedding ever!</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Hermès Story: How The Dumas Family Became One Of The Wealthiest Families In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The List</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifestyle Asia</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpqasrF2axbGxzaygr51dp7y6rctmrp6clJ67qL%2BMnq2eql2nrq%2B3xJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./minho-choi-min-ho.html><span>←</span><span>Minho (Choi Min-ho) Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography</span></a>
