It is an extremely personal album for the British music star, 33, who reflects upon her divorce from former husband <strong>Simon Konecki</strong>, 47. Adele has expressed how she hopes the album will explain the break down of their marriage to their son, <strong>Angelo</strong>, who is just nine years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Drake And Adele's Friendship</a></span></p><p>Adele and her ex-husband began dating in 2011, and married in a secret ceremony in 2018. Just months later, however, the relationship broke down. In March this year, the divorce was finalised. In the midst of her difficult divorce, Adele has been open about her desire to make their only child a priority. But what is Adele's relationship like with her son, Angelo? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=adele-claims-she-wanted-angelo-to-see-her-39-really-love-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Adele Claims She Wanted Angelo To See Her 'Really Love'</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Vogue</a>, the 'Hello' singer claimed the divorce was the best thing for Angelo, who was witnessing his parents fall out of love. Leaving the marriage, Adele said, was in "the pursuit of my own happiness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was just going through the motions and I wasn’t happy. Neither of us did anything wrong. Neither of us hurt each other or anything like that. It was just: I want my son to see me really love, and be loved. It’s really important to me," she said. "I’ve been on my journey to find my true happiness ever since."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Adele's Upcoming Album</a></span></p><h2 id=angelo-also-made-her-realise-how-unhappy-she-was><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Angelo Also Made Her Realise How Unhappy She Was</span></h2><p>It was also her son who made Adele realise how unhappy she was in the marriage with Angelo's father. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Describing an occasion when he was just six years old</a>: "He said to my face, 'Can you see me? And I was like, Uh, yeah. And he was like, Cause I can’t see you.' Well, my whole life fell apart in that moment. He knew I wasn’t there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This then inspired her to become open with her son about the difficulties she and Simon were experiencing: "That’s when I started sharing with him."</p><h2 id=she-39-s-struggled-to-help-angelo-understand-his-parents-39-divorce><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She's Struggled To Help Angelo Understand His Parents' Divorce</span></h2><p>Being open with her son hasn't been without its difficulties, however. There have often been more questions than answers, with Adele despairing as a mother.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Explaining the difficulty, Adele said</a>: "He has so many simple questions for me that I can’t answer, because I don’t know the answer," said the singer. "Like, Why can’t we still live together? That’s just not what people do when they get divorced. But why not? I’m like, I don’t f------ know. That’s not what society does. And: Why don’t you love my dad anymore? And I’d be like, I do love your dad. I’m just not in love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can’t make that make sense to a nine-year-old," she added.</p><h2 id=they-spend-a-lot-of-time-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Spend A Lot Of Time Together</span></h2><p>Adele is notoriously private about the details of her personal life, but has been open somewhat about the kinds of things she gets up to with her son. The most interesting details came up during Adele's recent '73 Questions' video interview with Vogue, in which she revealed the types of foods she likes to buy for her son, the kinds of TV shows they watch together, and the sorts of activities the pair get up to. It was clear that the pair share a close bond, and enjoy having fun whenever they can outside mum Adele's busy schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lil Nas X Is Under Fire For Alleged Past ‘Fatdele’ Comments After Praising Adele’s New Song</a></span></p><h2 id=she-keeps-him-shielded-from-her-fame><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Keeps Him Shielded From Her Fame</span></h2><p>Adele may be one of the most famous individuals on the planet, but she has made a point about keeping Angelo mostly oblivious to it, and knowing her simply as 'Mum.' He has accompanied her on tour from a young age, but is still largely oblivious to how big a deal his mother is - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and is perplexed when fellow pupils at school bring it up</a>: "There were a few older girls who chased him around, asking if I was his mom," Adele said. "He was just like: I think her name's Adele, yeah. My mom. My mom. I'm not Adele to him. He felt like he was being bullied, because they were annoying him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mum knew just what to say to help Angelo arm himself in future situations like this: "I said: That's not bullying. Just say, Yeah, she's my mom. She wiped my a**."</p><h2 id=there-family-set-up-is-almost-the-same-as-before-the-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>There Family Set Up Is Almost The Same As Before The Split</span></h2><p>Angelo's parents divorce has been finalised, with the former couple sharing joint custody of their son. Things haven't changed all that much though for the family, who are keeping things as similiar as possible to before. Simon has, in fact, bought the house directly opposite to Adele's, and so Angelo spends a great deal of time with both his parents, moving between their homes easily. The disruption to his life has been minimised, maintaining his relationship effectively with Mom and Dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Adele Fans Connect The Dots Between ‘Easy On Me’ And Earlier Videos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCdnKWdXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW64yKScZq%2BZqbVuv86nZJqml5q5sHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-highest-grossing-m-night-shyamalan-movies-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The Highest Grossing M.
