Williams attended Gonzaga College High School, while Orellana went to Richard Montgomery High School 16 miles away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Caleb-Williams-and-Valery-Orellana-Relationship-Timeline-3.jpg><p>One month later, Orellana shared a photo via her Instagram Story from an Oklahoma football game, where Williams began his career. (He transferred to the University of Southern California in 2021.)</p><p>They were seemingly still together in September 2022 when Orellana was tagged in an Instagram photo at a USC football game. The photo was presumably taken the week before when Williams made his home debut for the Trojans against Rice. USC played a road game the day before the photo was posted.</p><p>Fast forward to April 2024, and Williams was teasing who he was bringing with him to the NFL Draft, writing: ‚ÄúWait till yall see draft day suit and my ladies dress. 1 of 1s üòÜ.‚Äù</p><p>When he arrived on the red carpet on April 25, he went public with a new lady love ‚Äî <strong>Alina Thyregod.</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caleb Williams leaving the hotel and heading to the NFL Draft <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pJmUMJJ7m8</a></p><p>‚Äî CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) <a href=#>April 25, 2024</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>ESPN reported that the couple played Monopoly cards in their hotel room before heading to the venue in Detroit, Michigan. The Chicago Bears subsequently selected Williams to be the No. 1 pick.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big moment, but I‚Äôll definitely be happy,‚Äù Williams told Today ahead of the broadcast. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long time for an even longer time to come. So I‚Äôm ready. I‚Äôm ready for the moment and ready to be welcomed onstage in my suit and have a blast.‚Äù</p><p>He added that he didn‚Äôt expect to get too emotional. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt cry at the Heisman [ceremony]. Normally I cry after losses and big, big championship games and things like that. ‚Ä¶ But all the emotions on the field that you see, I probably won‚Äôt have those. Those are normally a bunch of adrenaline, a bunch of 60 minutes of kicking somebody‚Äôs tail.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZyar27DyKWjopmdqHqiusNmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSvmZyav7p5zqucpaSRo660edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./foxy-brown-calls-keith-murray-crackhead-1234727020.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Foxy Brown Calls Keith Murray A &amp;quot;Crackhead&amp;quot; After Sexual Claims</span></a>
