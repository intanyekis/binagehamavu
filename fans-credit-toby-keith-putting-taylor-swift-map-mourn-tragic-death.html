He fought his fight with grace and courage. Please respect the privacy of his family at this time."</strong> The music world woke up to this statement, and it changed everything. Toby Keith was a country legend, who embodied the genre and paved the way for so many artists that came after him. The musician had been battling cancer for a few years now, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he only made it public in June 2022</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/toby-keith-performing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Toby Keith's Health Update Didn't Prepare Fans For His Shocking Post-Cancer Transformation">Toby Keith's Health Update Didn't Prepare Fans For His Shocking Post-Cancer Transformation</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Toby Keith's appearance was unrecognizable post-cancer diagnosis. Sadly, fans won't ever get to see him performing again.</p><p>"Last fall I was diagnosed with stomach cancer," he shared with fans. "I've spent the last 6 months receiving chemo, radiation and surgery. So far, so good. I need time to breathe, recover, and relax. I am looking forward to spending this time with my family. But I will see the fans sooner than later. I can’t wait." Sadly, he didn't get to make this wish come true, but through his many decades in the business, he more than fulfilled everyone's expectations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-toby-gave-taylor-swift-her-chance>How Toby Gave Taylor Swift Her Chance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-good-morning-america.jpg><p>As people found out about the singer's passing, fans and colleagues shared their tributes to Toby Keith. Some of them pointed out something that a lot of readers might not know, and that is how instrumental he was at the beginning of Taylor Swift's career. Nowadays, Taylor is the face and sound of current pop music, but as true fans know, her beginnings were in country music, and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was Toby Keith's company, Big Machine Records, that first signed her in 2005</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was a completely unknown teenage artist at the time. Talented, of course, but new to the scene and inexperienced. He took a chance, getting her her first contract, and needless to say, it was a great decision on both parts. Although Taylor Swift changed her path eventually, turning to pop music, there are countless country influences present in her music to this day, and that is likely thanks to Toby Keith in many ways. It's probable we will get to see her heartfelt tribute to the musician soon.</p><p>Toby Keith's passing is a heavy loss for the music world. Our thoughts are with his family and friends in this challenging time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrCzscOiq2asn5fGbrfEoquhZaCqwbW1zaBkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaKusXnMqKyrpl2pv6KzyJxknZ2RqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-surprise-songs-in-eras-tour-movie-which-were-cut.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Surprise Songs in 'Eras Tour' Movie, Which Were Cut</span></a>
