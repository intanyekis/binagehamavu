The NBA champion recalled his first reaction to hearing <a href=# id=auto-tag_sexyy-red data-tag=sexyy-red>Sexyy Red</a> drop his name in her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234790899>viral song “Skee Yee,”</a> which he found surprising and humorous.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When Sexxy Red did it, I just started laughing,” he recalled. “I don’t know. I had never seen her at a basketball game.” The line he’s referring to is, “My sister in the backseat with a .30/ Ni**as tryna shoot they shot, Stephen Curry.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Curious to see how many other songs have mentioned his name, he shared the time that one of his teammates did some research on music’s fascination with referencing him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s funny because I actually was asking the question– no, one of my teammates were asking me the question, ‘How many times do you think your name’s been mentioned in the song?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure there’s probably a website or something that could probably count it for you.’ So he went and looked it up and it was like 106 I think at the time, which was wild to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Mentioning coveted rap stars like Drake and Future — who’ve both referenced his name before — he added, “Then I started thinking about all the ones that I could remember and it’s either a nickname, like Drake did with <a rel=nofollow href=#>‘Chef Curry with the Pot,’</a> or I think Future dropped one in the song ‘Mad Max.’ And it’s funny to see how they rhyme it because either they do a nickname, the short name, they use number 30 or they just go with the whole full name and just try to write something.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Curry then recalled Pluto’s 2022 single with Lil Durk from <a href=# data-type=attachment data-id=1234719756>Loyal Bros 2</a>, where he raps, “Keep it on the low/ Go drop a bag and get a ni**a buried/ Lil’ bro send shots all through your car, he think he Stephen Curry.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Future did the whole full name Stephen Curry, which is hilarious because he is trying to rhyme it and flow with it,” he said. “I don’t know, unfortunately, ‘somebody’s shooting something or <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234796238>sharp shooting</a>‘ or whatever the case is… I almost kind of expect it now. They’re going to reference me at some point.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drizzy, Cardi B, E-40, Lil Uzi Vert, Fat Joe, and Kehlani are just a few who have shown respect to the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234773580>four-time champion </a>through song. As there are so many lyrics to choose from, the 35-year-old shared a few of his favorite bars.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Drake’s for sure is my favorite,” he revealed. “Drake and Cardi B, surprisingly because she had the… I think it was the me and Ayesha reference. She’s like, ‘I want to get married like Steph and Ayesha, but we more like Belly; Tommy and Keisha.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Revisit Cardi B’s “Be Careful With Me” below and stay tuned for more from VIBE’s conversation with Steph Curry coming soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBprzHZpquqqKuerOxwJyroqeeYsCmxNiyZKudlGK7ornEZqqknZVixqaxjGppbGxoZYF0fpZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marlon-wayans-claps-back-at-troll-over-his-daughters-sexuality.html><span>←</span><span>Marlon Wayans Claps Back at Troll Over His Daughters Sexuality</span></a>
