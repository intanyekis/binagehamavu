Her desire to protect her little girl should not affect that agreement. However, he is also making it clear that if the Arthur Georg sock designer wants to alter the custody in any way, Chyna is ready for battle.</p><p>The sudden defense on her part stems from a recent outing at Six Flags Amusement Park. Chyna was with her two kids, King Cairo age five and Dream, when an altercation occurred. A video shows the Rob & Chyna star attempting to hurl her daughter’s pink car at someone. According to the 29-year-old, a woman slapped her and she was just trying to protect her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian was reportedly livid over his daughter being near the stroller incident, as well as concerned about the men his baby mama is bringing to her house when Dream is there.</p><p>Because of those two concerns, he threatened to have the custody arrangement changed or at the very least would like some restrictions put in place to ensure his daughter's safety.</p><p>However, it looks like his baby mama is not here for it. There have not been any official legal documents filed, but based on Chyna’s reaction to the possibility Kardashian is coming for her, it is going to get nasty.</p><p>Blac Chyna is prepared to fight back over custody of Dream, should Rob Kardashian attempt to change the current legal arrangement. There is a good chance if these two head back to court it will be ugly. Their relationship, as well as break-up, was a hot mess of fights that were full of hateful words and reportedly got physical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What do you think about the latest drama surrounding <a href=#>Chyna</a> and Kardashian?</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>BLAC CHYNA LOSES STROLLER SPONSOR AFTER SIX FLAGS INCIDENT&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nkqGupHnCobCnmV2nvKN5ypqpnZmjnbaiuoycrKysn5nGbrDRnpimZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yesjulz.html><span>←</span><span>YesJulz Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Facts, Biography</span></a>
