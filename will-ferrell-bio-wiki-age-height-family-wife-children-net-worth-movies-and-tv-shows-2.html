Ferrell’s attempts at stand up comedy had little success. He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was&nbsp;Harry Caray, the&nbsp;Hall of Fame&nbsp;baseball announcer.</p><p>Lorne Michaels who was then the producer of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live<i>&nbsp;</i>came to town looking for fresh talent for his show and that is how he discovered Ferrell as he made it through the first audition. Ferrell finally got a slot on Saturday Night Live<i>&nbsp;</i>where<i>&nbsp;</i>Ferrell made performances notable through his imitations of President George W. Bush, Attorney General Janet Reno, pompous television host James Lipton, and singer Neil Diamond, His impressions of Bush became wildly popular during the 2000 presidential election.</p><p>While on&nbsp;SNL, Ferrell also appeared in such feature films as the&nbsp;James Bond&nbsp;parody&nbsp;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997; Dick in 1999, a satire of the Watergate scandal and Zoolander. In 2002, Will left Saturday Night Live<i>&nbsp;</i>to pursue a film career and in the same year he landed a role as he was one of the stars in ‘Old School’, and he took the lead role in Elf in the year 2003, playing a charmingly naive human raised in Santa’s village who ventures to New York City. Both films were box office successes.</p><p>Other hits followed in the form of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy in 2004, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby 2006 and Blades of Glory in 2007. He later in the year 2010 took up the tole of an alien supervillain in the animated Megamind.</p><p>Although most of Ferrell’s film work was broadly comic in tone, he occasionally took on more serious roles including a methodical Internal Revenue Service agent in Stranger than Fiction and an alcoholic selling his possessions in Everything Must Go.</p><p>He also starred in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues in the year 2013 and in the next year he voiced a tyrannical businessman in The LEGO Movie. The actor also landed a role in <strong>Get Hard (released in 2015)</strong> where he played a hedge-fund manager who, after being framed for insider trading, looks to a black employee (Kevin Hart) for assistance on learning how to survive in prison.</p><p>He also starred as a hapless stepfather whose relationship with his stepchildren is challenged by the arrival of their father in Daddy’s Home (2015). In 2017 he co-starred with Amy Poehler in the film ‘The House’, a film that is about a suburban couple that runs an illegal casino in order to pay for their daughter’s college tuition.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-ferrel-get-hard></span>Will Ferrel Get Hard<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After millionaire <strong>James King</strong> (Will Ferrell) is sentenced to San Quentin prison for charges of fraud, he turns to <strong>Darnell Lewis</strong> (Kevin Hart) in order to “get hard” and prepare him for life behind bars.</p><p>Released back in 2015, the Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy Get Hard didn’t exactly receive the warmest reception when it hit theaters. It faced accusations of racism at its SXSW World Premiere, was bruised by a primarily negative critical response, and then failed to justify its $40 million budget with a $111 million global box office take.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-ferrell-awards></span>Will Ferrell Awards<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Will has numerous awards under his name including ESPY Awards, James Joyce Award, Kids Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards, Razzie Awards, Spike TV Guys’ Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards, Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, British GQ Men of the Year and several others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-ferrell-movies></span>Will Ferrell Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Saturday Night Live (1995–2002)</li><li>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)</li><li>A Night at the Roxbury (1998)</li><li>Superstar (1999)</li><li>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)</li><li>Zoolander (2001)</li><li>Old School (2003)</li><li>Elf (2003)</li></ul><ul><li>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)</li><li>The Producers (2005)</li><li>Bewitched (2005)</li><li>Kicking & Screaming (2005)</li><li>Stranger Than Fiction (2006)</li><li>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)</li><li>Curious George (2006)</li><li>Blades of Glory (2007)</li><li>Semi-Pro (2008)</li></ul><ul><li>Step Brothers (2008)</li><li>Land of the Lost (2009)</li><li>The Other Guys (2010)</li><li>Megamind (2010)</li><li>The Campaign (2012)</li><li>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013)</li></ul><ul><li>The Lego Movie (2014)</li><li>Get Hard (2015)</li><li>Daddy’s Home (2015)</li><li>Zoolander 2 (2016)</li><li>Daddy’s Home 2 (2017)</li><li>Holmes & Watson (2018)</li><li>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-will-ferrell></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Will Ferrell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-will-ferrell></span><strong>Who is Will Ferrell?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Will Ferrell (John William Ferrell) is an American actor, comedian, producer, and writer.
