The guy has pretty much been racing cars since he was a kid, falling in love with racing ever since his father bought him a radio-controlled car when he six-years-old, and you can easily tell this 33-year-old stud finds a thrill in going super fast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The four-time F1 champ is considered to be one of the most competitive drivers on the grid, however, when he's finished with his races, he still is out on the town driving fast in some of the most luxurious cars in the world. He's been caught driving over the speed limit multiple times and even had two of his Mercedes' impounded for driving dangerously. There is no question that this famous sports star loves to ride in the flashiest vehicles, and while he doesn't have a huge collection of cars, he does have a collection that is highly impressive.</p><p>Did we forget to mention that besides traveling around the world in the most extraordinary cars, he also has a $25 million private plane just in case his cars aren't taking him places quick enough? Here are 15 photos that prove Lewis Hamilton travels rich and is living a life people dream about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-s-introduce-you-to-his-25-million-private-plane>Let's Introduce You To His $25 Million Private Plane</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton knows a thing or two about luxurious cars and he also knows a little something about having one of the most stylish and expensive private planes in the world. The F1 driver is the owner of a Bombardier Challenger 605 private jet. Hamilton is not shy about showing off his lavish plane and has traveled around the world in it, including to Mexico, Monaco, Germany, and the United States, just to name a few. The plane is fitted with a pullout bed in case Hamilton needs a little nap from racing, several televisions, and even a bar. He even gave his plane his own personal touch by changing its registration to G-LCDH, which stands for Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-driven-around-in-a-2016-mercedes-maybach-s600>Getting Driven Around In A 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600</h2><p>When Lewis Hamilton isn't doing the driving, his personal driver is taking him around town in this white, 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600. It makes sense that Hamilton would be riding around in a Mercedes since his employer is the Mercedes AMG F1 team. The vehicle is 18 feet long, which is 8 feet longer than the regular S-Class to accommodate plush leather recliners. The car even comes with a selection of custom fragrances, seven different interior lighting color options, 3D surround sound system, and high-end leather just about everywhere. Not only is the car impressive on the inside, it also has some power to it. The car has a V-12 engine running with a 7-speed automatic transmission, 523 horsepower, and a 5-second sprint from 0 to 60 mph.</p><h2 id=hamilton-likes-his-motorcycles-too>Hamilton Likes His Motorcycles, Too</h2><p>Hamilton loves to test his limits and what better way than riding around on a motorcycle? The Formula One racecar driver is a big motorcycle enthusiast and regularly uses his MV Augusta Dragster RR LH44 bike to get around the pits. The motorcycle was created by the Italian company and features Lewis Hamilton logos, an Alcantara seat, ergo&nbsp;brake levers, handlebars, and a fuel filler cap. Instead of pushing his bike out of the pits after a race, Lewis enjoyed performing a burnout in pit lane. Even when Hamilton is at work, he still loves to show off his hot rods. Later on this list, you’ll see how the F1 driver upgraded his toy to a sweet candy apple red motorcycle, and we’re pretty sure it wasn’t cheap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-epic-hypercar>His Epic Hypercar</h2><p>Have you ever seen a purple Pagani Zonda 760LH driving around your neighborhood? It's very highly unlikely, but if you personally know Lewis Hamilton, then you've probably seen his unique ride out and about. There are only thirteen Pagani Zondas produced in the 760-series, and Hamilton's was the first installed with a six-speed manual transmission. The Italian car is most known for its purple paint color and selection of exposed carbon fiber elements. This car was specifically made for Lewis, with an engine that can put out around 760 bhp, creating a top speed of over 220 mph time of around 3.3 seconds. Lewis was spotted in his hypercar with Justin Bieber cruising around in Monaco. Who knew the two were BFFs?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=showing-off-his-1967-shelby-mustang-gt500-eleanor-replica>Showing Off His 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Eleanor Replica</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton has a thing for classic cars, too. The Formula One racecar driver shared a photo on his Instagram standing next to his Mustang Shelby GT500 in Venice Beach with his pooch. Hamilton is quite known for owning a few Mercedes, which you'll see later on this list, but it looks like this classic car has a special place in his heart, too. Hamilton captioned his Instagram photo with the hashtag #Eleanor, which refers to the car featured in the film, Gone in 60 Seconds, however, his car is actually a replica. Classic Recreations built it and, although it uses authentic Shelby parts, it is officially registered in the Shelby database and they use modern technology in the suspension and the 5.0-liter V8 Coyote engine. Still, we don't think anyone would complain about having a replica Eleanor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cruising-in-his-beautiful-1966-427-shelby-cobra>Cruising In His Beautiful&nbsp;1966 427 Shelby Cobra</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton loves posing in front of his rides. Here, the champion showed off a photo of himself with his original 1966 427 Shelby Cobra. He shared this photo just weeks after he posted the photo of himself and his dog standing next to his candy red, 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500. The sports star is definitely living it up in Los Angeles and with a few of these cars built; Lewis knows he'll be receiving a lot of attention on the streets of L.A. From its performance to its bodywork, the car is a beauty. Apparently, Hamilton was taking his younger half-brother Nicholas for a spin and they later posed for a couple of selfies with the car. Who wouldn't? There was a similar model to Hamilton's in red that was set to sell for a whopping $1,600,000-$2,000,000!</p><h2 id=showing-off-his-blue-mclaren-p1>Showing Off His Blue McLaren P1</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton no longer drives for the McLaren team anymore; however, he has a long history and connection with the competing Formula One team. So, it wasn't a surprise when the racecar driver was spotted driving in this blue McLaren P1 around his home in Monaco. The car is astounding and a color that is&nbsp;unlike any other P1 vehicles. Like his Pagani Zonda 760LH, the car also features exposed carbon fiber elements. Other features of the car include glass wing mirrors, wheels with blue outer pinstripes, and a blue and black theme continued inside the car. Monaco is a country where you'll see a lot of supercars, but Hamilton knows how to buy cars that'll make sure he'll get noticed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=racing-the-mercedes-benz-300-slr-w-196-s-in-the-legendary-parabolica>Racing The Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR (W 196 S) In The Legendary Parabolica</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton got a chance to race Sir Stirling Moss, a British former Formula One racing driver and inductee into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, in 2015, in a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR W 196 S in the legendary Parabolica. The car is an iconic, 2-seat sports racer that took sportscar racing by storm in the 1950's. One feature that put this car way ahead of its time was the emergency anti-lock braking aid used by injecting oil onto the surface of the brakes. At that time, the car was the fastest road-going car in the world, with a top speed of 290 km/h. The car's full potential was never reached because of a tragic disaster in what many racecar enthusiasts would recognize as one of the worst in the history of racing. However, the car still remains one of the best racing cars ever made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pulling-up-in-his-ferrari-laferrari>Pulling Up In His Ferrari LaFerrari</h2><p>Just because Lewis Hamilton drives for the Mercedes AMG Petronas team doesn't mean he can't own a Ferrari. Hamilton might have received some angry calls from Mercedes after he was spotted driving around in his personalized LaFerrari, but as a lover of all things luxurious and fast, Hamilton had to get his hands on one of these sick rides. The LaFerrari is one of the most prestigious cars in the Ferrari collection and there are a very limited amount of models. With a starting price of over $1 million, only a few people are able to own this precious car. Just like his other cars, Hamilton enjoys putting his own personal touches on it. He added a red roof rather than the standard gloss black. The wheels are painted black and have red outer rims. This impeccable car has the ability to reach speeds of over 217 mph. Other stars like Floyd Mayweather and Justin Bieber are also owners of this vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=driving-his-custom-designed-mercedes>Driving His&nbsp;Custom Designed Mercedes</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg were able to customize their own Mercedes-AMG SL-Class models and even demonstrated their driving skills in these luxurious rides. Hamilton decided on a matte black for his car with gold accents, both inside and outside the vehicle. Hamilton is no stranger to personalizing his rides, so this one is no surprise. Mercedes-Benz only produced 19 of each model that each sports star and each model in the "World Championship 2014 Collector's Edition" is effectively one-of-a-kind. Each car is dedicated to one of the 19 Formula 1 racetracks used in 2014. Lewis' car comes in the special paint finish design, night black mango, which can also be found on the exterior mirrors, door handles, and rims, while the gold-colored lettering, fins, and stripes on the rear bumper shows a feeling of power, according to a Mercedes-Benz description.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=test-driving-the-mclaren-mp4-12c>Test Driving The McLaren MP4-12C</h2><p>For the opening of the McLaren London Showroom At One Hyde Park in London, England, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, a British racing driver and former Formula One driver, arrived in style in a McLaren MP4-12C. The beautiful car beat out the Ferrari 458 Italia in speed and the car's technology makes this vehicle quite astounding. Part of the car's development took place on the McLaren's motorsport simulator, the most advanced of its type in the world. It's MP4's brake-steer and airbrake tech is Formula 1-inspired. Only someone like Lewis Hamilton could test drive such a stunning vehicle and the two race drivers even got to hit the track in the car to have some fun before they drove to the unveiling of it. Must be a tough life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yet-again-posing-with-his-luxury-toys>&nbsp;Yet Again, Posing With His Luxury Toys</h2><p>Lewis Hamilton really likes to show off his cars and while his collection isn't extensive, they are some of the most luxurious. The race drivers Mercedes SLS AMG Black Series is no exception and looks more like a spaceship than a car. While the regular SLS is already a supercar, the SLS Black goes from 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds and looks super sleek. The car features blacked outside vents and massive wheels, and you can’t forget to mention the cars gullwing doors. Lewis definitely knows how to pick out his rides and this one is just another very good-looking car he's added to his collection. In the photo, you can also see Hamilton's SL 65 AMG Black Series, while he poses with the two German supercars while overlooking the ocean.</p><h2 id=showing-us-his-monster-rides>Showing Us His Monster Rides</h2><p>Hamilton showed off the next car he'll be adding to his already full car garage with this Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG 6x6 mega giant. Lewis' decision to get one of these mammoth rides was probably because Mercedes only built the G 63 6×6 in limited numbers, so the F1 driver just had to get his hands on it. The vehicle took inspiration from the vehicles used for the Australian army and was actually supposed to be used for the army, however, due to the foreseen demand for the road version of the car, Mercedes decided to offer it to the public. The car is 5867 mm long, 2111 mm wide and 2209 mm tall, and features two extra wheels and an additional axel. It is truly one of Lewis' most impressive rides.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=designing-his-own-motorbike>Designing His Own Motorbike</h2><p>Of course, Lewis Hamilton couldn't just have one motorcycle. The Formula 1 driver and MV Agusta collaborated to design this bike named the F4 LH44. Thanks to the success of his first project on the Dragster RR LH, it was only time that Hamilton would help design another killer looking bike. The bike features Hamilton's Panther logo, and its most striking feature is its beautiful candy apple red color. "My projects with MV Agusta are a great way to combine my love of riding bikes with my interest in the creative design process so I am very much involved with the CRC design team throughout. I am particularly excited to introduce my new bike, the F4 LH44. It looks quite stunning and I had the pleasure of riding on track a few weeks ago in Italy, it feels great and combines the best of both worlds, a race bike for the road!" Hamilton stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=revealing-his-new-racecar-with-mercedes>Revealing His New Racecar With Mercedes</h2><p>We can't talk about Lewis Hamilton's rides without mentioning his racecar. Mercedes revealed the W09 with Lewis and driver, Valtteri Bottas, in February 2018. It was the first time Hamilton had seen the vehicle in one piece and hailed the car as "a work of art" that he hopes will carry him onto a fifth world title. "This is the most exciting part of the year to this point— to see the whole car come together," Hamilton said, adding, "I've seen the development of the car for the last eight months and so to see all the pieces together, it's a work of art." Hamilton drove the car after the unveiling and later tweeted: "In complete awe. The amount of focus, determination, and expertise into every ounce of this car is astounding. I can't wait to get racing and push this beast to its limits." Here's hoping for a fifth victory!</p><p>References: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebritycarsblog.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">yahoo.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">carkeys.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">businessinsider.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">topgear.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube.com&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJmiqHxygYypoJyrXaSzbrjEsKCsZZiWuqq406ilZqSZq7avs4yloKSdXam1pnmQZqCnZZiewG641LGsq7Fdp7alsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joy-taylor.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sports Anchor Joy Taylor?
