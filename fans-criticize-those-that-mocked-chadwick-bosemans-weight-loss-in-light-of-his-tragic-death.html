This image was taken from a video shot by the actor earlier in the year, which he eventually deleted.</p><p><span class="next-single related-single">Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chadwick Boseman Was Always Skinny, But Now He's Scary Skinny</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans believed he took down&nbsp;that video post because of&nbsp;users' comments on how&nbsp;thin he looked; they&nbsp;believe that he didn't want the video to reveal his sickness to the world. On top of their sadness about his passing,&nbsp;fans were devastated that he was mistreated in any way because of his physical appearance.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Skinny Joe Manganiello Used To Be</a></span></p><p>Another Twitter user cited the specific language one article used in describing&nbsp;Boseman&nbsp;as "deathly skinny," not realizing that&nbsp;he was facing a fatal disease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the&nbsp;writer was likely unaware that Chadwick had cancer, as most of the world only found out yesterday, after his death, it&nbsp;reminded fans of how&nbsp;desensitized and ignorant both the media and&nbsp;public can be to individuals facing&nbsp;personal adversity - especially when it comes to body weight.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another Celebrity Experiences A Body-Shaming Incident...

A few Twitter users reminded everyone that people claimed "he was on crack" or "he was on drugs" when looking at pictures of Chadwick Boseman over the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans continued to defend Boseman, others commended his resiliency in shooting movies with this diagnosis.&nbsp;During the making of these movies, Chadwick Boseman was constantly transforming his body and putting it on the line for his craft, in spite of the unique and harrowing challenges he faced.</p><p>As more stories come out about Boseman, we send our condolences to his family and friends.</p><p>Thank you, Chadwick Boseman, for everything you did for your movies, and your fans.
