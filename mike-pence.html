After working as a lawyer in private practice for a while, he made the decision to enter politics. He made the decision to run for Democratic representative in the year 1988, but after failing to win, he chose to try again. Then, in a short amount of time, he rose to prominence in politics.</p><p>Mike Pence joined the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 and held this position until 2013. In 2013, he also took office as Indiana’s 50th governor, a role he held until 2017. When Donald Trump was elected president, he was appointed as the 48th vice president of the United States, a position he held until 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mike_Pence_News></span><strong>Mike Pence News </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Mike Pence refers to Vivek Ramaswamy as a “rookie” According to a former US vice president, now is not the time for on-the-job training.</strong></p><p>The technology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, 38, made a surprise appearance at the Republican National Committee Debate in Milwaukee. Alongside well-known figures like former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he positioned himself.</p><p>Ramaswamy was given a prominent spot on the stage, sitting close to Governor DeSantis, as a result of his unexpected ascent in recent polls. Ramaswamy lost no time in showing his polished manner and messaging as the conversation progressed. He emphasized his own background as the son of immigrants and his achievements as a software entrepreneur, bragging about his capacity to launch billion-dollar businesses.</p><p>However, Ramaswamy’s endeavor to set himself apart from his rivals took a forceful turn. He purposefully cast himself in the role of the outsider, claiming to be the only candidate unaffected by special interests. He attacked his rivals as “super PAC puppets” who used scripted phrases to derail his campaign in a heated exchange of words.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mike_Pence_versus_Vivek_Ramaswamy></span><strong>Mike Pence versus Vivek Ramaswamy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>By drawing on his significant political experience, former vice president and Republican heavyweight Mike Pence attacked Ramaswamy’s outsider position. Pence highlighted his extensive experience as a lawmaker, governor, and vice president. He promoted himself as the most qualified conservative candidate in the campaign and insisted that he was ready for the job.</p><p>Pence mockingly said, “Now is not the time for on-the-job training,” referring to Ramaswamy’s relative lack of experience. “We don’t need to hire an amateur,”</p><p>“I think I am unquestionably the best prepared, the most tested, the most qualified, and the proven conservative in this race,” he continued.</p><p>‘A president can’t accomplish everything,’ Vivek recently said. Well, Vivek, I have some news for you. I’ve been in the West Wing and the hallway. Every situation that affects America must be addressed by the president of the United States, Pence said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pence_defends_the_actions_of_Donald_Trump></span><strong>Pence defends the actions of Donald Trump</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Pence also defended the administration’s stances, citing his previous experience in a number of government positions. He declared his capacity to tackle the many issues facing the country and emphasized his commitment to reviving economic growth and fiscal sustainability.</p><p>“I will reestablish economic restraint and put our country back on the path to growth and prosperity. In the same manner that I did in Congress, as governor, and as vice president,” Pence stated.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Corey Davis Wiki, Wikipedia, Contract, Wife, Net Worth, College Stats, Age, Earnings, Retire, Retirement, Career Stats, Brother</a></li><li><a href=#>Anthony Coley Wikipedia, Wife, Family, Spouse, Net Worth, Wiki, Age, Twitter</a></li><li><a href=#>Candace Rondeaux Wikipedia, Wiki, Husband, Wagner, Partner, Eyes, Twitter, Married</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopZmgsm68xKeanmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justice-for-the-hintts-family-maddie-hintts-fiance-and-sons-murdered-where-is-killer-alize-smith-today-2.html><span>←</span><span>Justice For The Hintts Family Maddie Hintts Fiance and Sons Murdered, Where Is Killer Alize</span></a>
