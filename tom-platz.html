He was only nine years old when he saw Dave Draper sitting on the beach with Betty Weider the image stayed with him, and he decided to start working out.</p><p>When he was 11 years old, he came across the title of Mr. Universe in a magazine and told himself that he would one day become Mr. Universe. He did his weightlifting exercises in his basement, and his father provided him with everything he needed because he was too young to attend the gym – Tom hasn’t disclosed any specifics about his parents, but he frequently recalls how helpful and supportive they were of his aspirations.</p><p>Tom did not work on his legs because he had back problems – he told his buddies that working on your legs would just lead to back problems, but he had no clue he would later become the owner of some of the greatest formed legs in bodybuilding history.<br>Tom is said to have dated a number of girls in high school, but he has not verified this. After graduating from high school, he completely focused on his bodybuilding career and did not attend college right away – he enrolled later at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, and obtained his degree in fitness science, and then went on to obtain his master’s degree in business administration from the University of California.</p><h2><span id=Tom_Platz-_Relationship_Married_Life>Tom Platz- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Tom is quite private about his love life, and he hasn’t revealed much about his previous and present affairs to the public. He is a married man he met his future wife Cha Nikito-Platz at a gym in Detroit, they began dating after only a few days, and they have been together ever since the date of their wedding is unknown. They don’t appear to have any children because they both want to focus on their professions.</p><p>Tom hasn’t spoken about any other woman he may have dated before Cha, but his followers believe he dated a lot of them. He and his wife currently own and operate a fitness consulting firm in Southern California.</p><h2><span id=Tom_Platz-_Professional_Career>Tom Platz- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Tom was only 15 when he left home and relocated to Kansas City; he transferred to a different high school but was mostly concerned with his future profession as a bodybuilder. He decided to acquire a job so he wouldn’t be a financial burden on his parents, and he traveled to a neighboring health spa center to inquire about working as a trainer at their gym.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was too young for the job, the management noticed Tom’s promise and predicted that he would bring a lot of people to the gym. He hired Tom (illegally), which proved out to be a smart decision because the gym quickly became crowded with individuals who wanted to do weights and look like Tom. At 17, he was still working at the gym, and a couple of individuals there who were training showed him how to do correct squats after they saw Tom wasn’t proficient at these exercises.</p><p>He didn’t like the workouts at first, but he did them anyway because he thought he should still work on his legs he considered his leg exercises as minor and kept them short, lasting no more than 15 minutes. Tom moved to Detroit to train out at the Armento’s gym, where he met Olympic weightlifters who taught him everything he needed to know about leg workouts.<br>He blended several training routines he learned, and his legs became something that other bodybuilders aspired to have.</p><h3><span id=His_first_significant_competitions>His first significant competitions</span></h3><p>Tom started competing seriously in 1973 when he entered the Mr. Adonis competition – he continued competing as an amateur for the next five years, winning the World Amateur Championship in 1978, after which he focused on attending professional competitions, aiming to become Mr. Olympia – unfortunately for him, he competed at seven IFBB Mr. and competitions from 1979 to 1986, with the exception of 1983, but his best score was rating third at the IFBB Mr. Olympia 1981.</p><p>On 20 May 1985, he released a single book named “Pro-style Bodybuilding.” He has also starred in various films, including “Who Killed Johnny Love?” in 1998, “8 Heads in a Duffel Bag” in 1997, “Book of Love” in 1990, and “Twins” in 1988.</p><h3><span id=The_world8217s_most_popular_male_bodybuilders>The world’s most popular male bodybuilders</span></h3><p>The Ranker website has developed a list of the world’s most popular male bodybuilders, including those who have moved on to other sectors such as movies and music. We will list the best five male bodybuilders in the world as determined by popular vote:</p><ul><li>The fifth spot is held by Mickey Hargitay, an actor who has crowned Mr. Universe in 1955. He is well-known for his roles in films such as “Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter,” “The Loves of Hercules,” and “Promises! Promises.”</li><li>Anthony White is in the fourth position; better known as Tony Atlas in the ring, he is a bodybuilder, powerlifter, and professional wrestler. He is presently working with WWE and owns the Mr. USA bodybuilding title.</li><li>In third place is Bob Paris, a writer, actor, public speaker, civil rights activist, and bodybuilder who rose to prominence after winning the 1983 NPC American National and the IFBB World Bodybuilding Championship.</li><li>Second place is held by Lou Ferrigno, an actor, fitness trainer, and bodybuilder – he has won IFBB Mr. America and IFBB Mr. Universe two times in a row, and is the star of the “Pumping Iron” documentary movie; Top place is held by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is mostly famous for his acting career and his starring role in the “Terminator” movie franchise – he is also a model, producer, director, activist, businessman.</li><li>Despite being a well-built bodybuilder, Tom is nowhere to be found on the Ranker website’s list of the world’s most popular male bodybuilders.</li></ul><h2><span id=Diet_and_exercise>Diet and exercise</span></h2><p>Tom developed his own exercise method, which he did not reveal to the world until he retired from competition. His plan was to deceive his mind into thinking he was much shorter than he actually was, which would allow him to lift more weight he even wore longer socks to help test the notion. Squats, hack squats, leg extensions, lying leg curls, standing calf raises, seated calf raises, and hack machine calf raises were among the leg exercises he frequently performed.</p><p>Tom’s diet consisted primarily of protein and carbohydrates, and he ate more than six times per day. He mostly ate whole-grain toast, milk, eggs, veggies, salad, poultry, fish, and fruits.</p><h2><span id=Interests_and_hobbies>Interests and hobbies</span></h2><p>Tom was largely interested in working out when he was participating in bodybuilding, but he now has a variety of hobbies that are unrelated to working out.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>He is <strong>5ft 8ins (1.72m)</strong> tall, has short blonde hair, blue eyes, and weighs roughly <strong>230lbs (104kgs)</strong>.</p><h2><span id=Social_media>Social media</span></h2><p>Tom is quite active on multiple big social media networks, as this is critical to the online image he has established for himself.</p><p>He started his Twitter account in July 2011 and has approximately 1,500 followers and has tweeted over 110 times. His Instagram account, on the other hand, has over 200,000 followers, and he has published over 100 photos to it — he also has a Facebook profile, which has over 31,000 fans.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a href=#>Kwhxte</a>, and <a href=#>Renata Jara</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Bodybuilder</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Eric Nenninger</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Laura Dotson</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqbyuec%2BlmK2yXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-rishel-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>The painful death of Jordan Rishel: Jordan Rishel Has Tragically Passed Away By Car Accident</span></a>
