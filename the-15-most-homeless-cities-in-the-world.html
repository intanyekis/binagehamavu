In Europe alone, there are 3 million people on the streets. In Australia and Canada, hundreds of thousands of people are homeless. Of course, the problem is much worse in poorer countries. There are over 9.5 million homeless people in Columbia and 24.4 million in Nigeria. In total, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights estimates that the world has 100 million homeless people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How do people end up on the streets? Job losses, foreclosures, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing all play a part. Social factors can also be part of the problem; domestic violence, lack of a supportive family, drug abuse, alcoholism and mental illnesses all contribute to homelessness.</p><p>Finding a solution to the homelessness problem has been hard for many cities, states and countries. The current New York mayor has a notoriously tough time reducing the number of 'cluster sites' in his city. Some cities,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Moscow, have no programs in place to fight the problem despite the numbers of homeless people growing steadily. Other cities such as Phoenix and San Francisco have put measures in place to reduce homelessness, such as newspapers which are given to the homeless population to sell and earn a living.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some cities are struggling much more than others, and some are overwhelmed by levels of poverty. These fifteen cities have bigger homeless populations than anywhere else in the world.</p><h2 id=15-athens-greece><strong>15.

About 50% of the homeless population&nbsp;roams the streets of Athens. A high rate of homelessness in this, the home of Aristotle and Plato, is largely down to the aggressive recession that hit Greece&nbsp;during the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>The recession hit the country hard, reducing its gross domestic product by as much as 25% and causing unemployment rates to soar to 27%. Many people have also lost their lucrative jobs. According to the Athens city hall, most of these people suffer from&nbsp;depression, with 60% resorting&nbsp;to drugs and alcohol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-phoenix-arizona-united-states><strong>14.

The Phoenix Rescue Mission suggests&nbsp;that the main reasons people end up homeless are foreclosures, job losses and evictions.</p><p>Social situations such as drug and alcohol addiction, mental conditions, and domestic violence also force people onto the streets.</p><p>Of&nbsp;the city’s homeless, 43%&nbsp;are reported to have mental conditions while 21% attest to abusing drugs. Almost half of first-time homeless people say that job losses and foreclosures are the main reasons for their homelessness. The state of Arizona has established the Arizona Commission for Homelessness and Housing, and the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness, to address the issue through education, advocacy and special projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-san-francisco-northern-california-united-states><strong>13.

This homeless advocacy association aims at reducing this number over the next few years. It was formed in 1987 and created an ingenious way to end homelessness: Printing and distributing a magazine, which they called the Street Sheet, to the homeless to sell.</p><p>Today, they print 17,000 copies of this newspaper, which is actually the longest constantly running newspaper of its kind in North America. In 1990, the organization also developed the Community Housing Partnership that has since set up over 1,000 permanent housing units for the homeless people in San Francisco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-washington-d-c-united-states><strong>12.

D.C., formally the District of Columbia, faces crippling homelessness with over 57,000 people on the streets.</p><p>Of these, 13,000&nbsp;reside on the streets of Washington. These individuals are so deep in abject poverty that they cannot meet basic needs such as buying food or clothes. Five in every 10 homeless adults reported a $0 income while 30% tested positive for chronic health problems.</p><p>This number is higher in the female population given that 80% are living with HIV and chronic diseases. What’s more disheartening is that their access to crucial medical care is significantly reduced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-boston-massachusetts-united-states><strong>11.

It also has the highest number of people living in emergency shelters – 16,540, to be precise.</p><p>According to surveys, up to 25% of the homeless have jobs, but these jobs do not pay enough to fund a roof over their heads.</p><p>The director of the Emergency Shelter Commission for the Boston Public Health Commission states that the city has one of the highest family homelessness rates due to the high costs associated with housing in Boston. However,&nbsp;Boston has very few homeless people wandering the streets: It has a strict ‘right to shelter’ law that requires the state to find a place for qualified families living rough to live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-sao-paulo-brazil><strong>10.

Sao Paulo is the most populous city in Brazil, as well as in the Americas.</p><p>Life on these streets as a homeless person is excruciating. Approximately 50% of the homeless people in Sao Paulo are housed in emergency camps, but the other half, the one that gets it hard, sleeps on the streets. They are forced to face notoriously harsh treatment from Brazilian authorities.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-budapest-hungary><strong>9.

The law shocked human rights groups, since unemployment and debt rates are sharply increasing. There are 20,000 more homeless people throughout Hungary.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-buenos-aires-argentina><strong>8.

Sadly, 30% are children and 13% are elderly. The city provides shelters for the destitute, but it can only shelter a maximum of 1,700 people. The number of those without a roof over their heads is growing, and their chances of gaining employment are dwindling.

Apart from this, he says that most down-and-out people owe numerous debts and have drug and substance abuse problems.

Suharto instituted policies that oppressed the locals. His administration would grab land that was privately held under the pretence of development. However, the land was only used to enrich the government.</p><p>This, in turn, pushed many people into the streets. The number has continued to grow over the years. In 2013, killer floods shattered the homes of over 100,000 people, adding that number to the total homeless people in the city.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-mexico-city-mexico><strong>5.

Although Bill’s administration is trying to move them into permanent houses, it is proving hard to fight the stubborn cluster site problem.

These children are faced with numerous problems including the abuse of drugs such as marijuana, shabu and cough syrups, health problems due to the deplorable conditions in which they live in, child prostitution by pedophiles and foreign sex tourists, and the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Recently, when the pope was visiting the country, numerous street children were rounded up and locked in cages.
