Yet the beauty staple was only introduced into Taylor's repertoire in 2009, when she posed for an Allure cover. While chatting with Hoda and Jenna on Today With Hoda & Jenna, makeup artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gucci Westman discussed Taylor Swift's first red lip moment</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together">All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</p><p>Westman said she had the idea of slathering Taylor in red lipstick simply because she hadn't seen the young starlet wear the color before.</p><p>Though she happily recounted the birth of Taylor's biggest makeup moment for an interview, Gucci Westman didn't give away all of Taylor's lipstick secrets. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Westman also noted in an Instagram throwback</a> years later that she sent Taylor home with her own tube of red lipstick, but didn't say what brand it was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Westman may have started the trend, but she's far from the only makeup artist to slather red lipstick on Ms. Swift. In 2022, Pat McGrath — the makeup artist behind Taylor's "Bejeweled" video, 2010 Met Gala, and 2022 VMAs looks — said that Taylor is the ideal canvas for a red lip look.</p><p>Pat used three shades of lip pencil for "Bejeweled," plus her seeming trademark Elson lip color.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McGrath also sells a product called "The 'Taylor-Made Lip Kit',"</a> which includes a MatteTrance lipstick in Elson (Blue Red) and a PermaGel Ultra Lip Pencil in Night Fever (Bright Pink). McGrath calls this Taylo's "on-set lip duo," which seems to suggest that Taylor wears the color combo for performances.</p><p>The red lipstick became a trademark of Taylor's, but it also drew attention to her mouth; <a href=#>fans worried over Taylor's smile even after she had her teeth fixed</a>. Today, she seems to have a shiny new smile to go along with her bold lipstick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-39-s-swift-39-s-mom-was-not-happy-about-the-red-lipstick>Taylor's Swift's Mom Was Not Happy About The Red Lipstick</h2><h3 id=andrea-swift-argued-in-favor-of-a-more-neutral-style-for-taylor>Andrea Swift argued in favor of a more neutral style for Taylor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-2024-02-16t125806-910.jpg><p>The red lipstick clearly caught on, and Taylor began wearing it more often, leading fans to start imitating the look. But there was one thing that could have stopped the entire phenomenon from happening: Taylor's mom.</p><p>Gucci Westman recounted that during Taylor Swift's fated Allure photo shoot, Taylor's mama was apparently the only naysayer in the bunch.

Not to mention, Taylor was an adult at the time, so while her mom's input was considered (and likely her dad's, as <a href=#>Taylor has close relationships with her parents</a>), the star didn't have to abide by a certain set of rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nor was it considered "scandalous" when Taylor donned red lipstick (in contrast with other teen-turned-adult stars like Miley Cyrus' makeup moments).</p><p>Fortunately, Andrea didn't put up too much of a fuss, and, as Gucci Westman noted, "The rest is history."</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-red-lipstick-is-iconic-even-google-has-taken-note>Taylor Swift's Red Lipstick Is Iconic: Even Google Has Taken Note</h2><h3 id=taylor-has-driven-red-lipstick-sales-into-the-stratosphere>Taylor has driven red lipstick sales into the stratosphere</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-attends-event.jpg><p>When it comes to their makeup looks, Swifties want nothing more than for life to imitate art.
