The game has spawned numerous titles across almost all recent gaming consoles so there’s no doubting that it’s one of the most successful franchised there is out there. Although the series has lost its once illustrious flair, there’s no doubting that it left mark on the genre it sought to dominate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series tells tales of an order of assassin’s across several time periods and locations. The twist is that the story is told through a simulation program called the Animus. With the Animus, players are able to relive the lives of the world’s best assassin’s including Altair, Ezio, Connor and Edward.</p><p>Each Assassin’s Creed game is set in a vast open-world filled with a lot of secrets, collectibles and so much more. Ubisoft does its best when developing a thriving open-world for the entries in the series and we couldn’t thank the developer enough for all the countless hours of fun we’ve had living the life of an assassin.</p><p>Another fun thing about Assassin’s Creed games is that it is always filled to the brim with Easter Eggs that players can discover and sometimes&nbsp;miss out on. Aside from the main story and side-quests, players are always on the lookout for the Easter Eggs that Ubisoft hides in each entry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That being said, there have been a ton of excellent hidden gems in the series; some more well-hidden than others. Here are the top 15 Easter Eggs in Assassin’s Creed that you might have missed.</p><h2 id=15-the-auditore-family><strong>15. The Auditore Family</strong></h2><p></p><p>There are a few interesting easter eggs featuring Assassin’s Creed 2’s Ezio Auditore and his family. During one part of the game, players can help Ezio see his family for a brief moment. It’s a pretty sad scene to say the least but at least we get to help out the poor assassin.</p><p>After meeting with Niccolo Machiavelli, Ezio will be given the chance to go to Palazzo Auditore. If players step into the center of the courtyard, Ezio will suddenly enter into trance. This trance can be compared to his Eagle Vision but instead of seeking out landmarks in a certain area, Ezio will be able to get a glimpse of his siblings and parents in the palazzo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In another neat easter egg featuring Ezio and his family, his uncle, Mario Auditore will say “it’s-a me, Mario,” during their first meeting. It’s pretty obvious who Mario Auditore is referencing and all he needs is a red cap and a plumber’s suit to really fill the role.</p><h2 id=14-bruce-wayne-in-italy><strong>14. Bruce Wayne In Italy</strong></h2><p></p><p>Who knew Batman would make his way into Renaissance Italy? The world’s greatest detective wasn’t exactly there but a few references to the popular DC hero were seen in Assassin’s Creed 2. Batman actually fits into the world of Assassin’s Creed perfectly so it’s a neat callout to the caped crusader.</p><p>When free-running, climbing walls or doing acrobatic things that assassins do, bystanders will often say “another caped crusader.” “Caped Crusader,” is one of Batman’s most popular monikers. Aside from this easter egg, when Rosa greets Ezio, she’ll initiate the conversation by saying “why so serious?” It’s one of the most popular lines from The Dark Knight’s Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger. With all these callouts to Batman, we wouldn’t be too surprised if there comes a Batman game set in the world of Assassin’s Creed. Our fingers crossed that someone thinks of this pretty soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-connor-and-the-flying-machine><strong>13. Connor And The Flying Machine</strong></h2><p></p><p>Even Assassin’s Creed games make references to other Assassin’s Creed games. In Assassin’s Creed 3, players will get the chance to see a callout to Assassin’s Creed 2. After completing a series of Homestead missions and successfully getting the stolen blueprints for Lance O’Donnell, players will be treated to a funny scene.</p><p>Connor will have the chance to talk to Lance outside the Davenport Manor. There, Lance reveals that the blueprints contained designs for a flying machine. This of course is a callout to Leonardo da Vinci, one of the major characters in Assassin’s Creed 2 as he helped Ezio with his inventions and gadgets.</p><p>Like Ezio from Assassin’s Creed 2, Connor would ask Lance if he could use the flying machine. However, unlike Ezio, Connor helplessly crashed into the water by the bay. Only Da Vinci was probably able to make the machine work and not Lance.</p><h2 id=12-jack-the-ripper><strong>12. Jack The Ripper</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This entry’s not really well hidden, in fact, it’s a DLC for Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. However, having to face against one of London’s most feared criminals is an Easter Egg worth mentioning. It’s not just a DLC wherein players get a glimpse of Jack The Ripper, but it’s a face-off with one of history’s most dangerous criminals as well.</p><p>The DLC itself doesn’t account for what Jack The Ripper did during his days. There’s no historical reference of his crimes in the game but his acts and how he committed the murders were spot on. In the DLC, players are able to kill Jack The Ripper and this is perhaps the biggest difference between the legend and the video game. In real life, no one even knows&nbsp;who the real Jack The Ripper is. All we know is that he’s a cold-blooded criminal out for a murdering spree.</p><h2 id=11-ubisoft-s-biggest-titles><strong>11. Ubisoft’s Biggest Titles</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like in Assassin’s Creed 4, players are taken into a deep look at the fictional Abstergo Entertainment’s HQ. Also like in Assassin’s Creed 4, players are taken through Abstergo Entertainment’s Montreal building. This time around, there are more references to Ubisoft’s past titles in the said building.</p><p>Aside from Assassin’s Creed media being seen inside the building, players can also a handful of Ubisoft’s most popular title. The list of visible references include Far Cry 3, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and Splinter Cell: Conviction. But of course, Ubisoft made sure not to actually put their titles inside Abstergo’s building. There are subtle differences in the references including the 3 in Far Cry 3 being replaced with a 5 instead. Ubisoft has had quite a few excellent titles already and seeing the titles as Easter Eggs in its biggest franchise is a simple yet awesome treat for fans of the developer.</p><h2 id=10-assassin-s-creed-predator><strong>10. Assassin’s Creed Predator</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a few interesting trophies and achievements to get in the games from the Assassin’s Creed series. Some are part of the story, while some are just downright wacky and neat. One of the trophies in Assassin’s Creed 3: Liberation, players get to experience what it’s like to become one of the best hunters in the universe.</p><p>The trophy called Predator is done simply by climbing on a tree, using Eagle Vision and then killing an enemy with a blowdart. It’s a pretty simple task but the underlying reference in it makes getting it all the more fun, especially for players who are akin to horror movies like Predator.</p><p>To get the trophy, players have to do what Predators do best; stalk. In the movies, Predators stalk humans atop trees and almost anywhere and use thermal vision. With the enemy in sight, predators will use a plasma cannon to dispose of unwary prey.</p><h2 id=9-games-in-a-game><strong>9. Games In A Game</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Assassin’s Creed 4 is home to quite a handful of references to other video games. Aside from Abstergo Entertainment’s HQ featuring odes to the series, the 4th main entry in the series also tips its hat off to other games; some were not even developed by Ubisoft.</p><p>One of the assassin’s contract the Edward can undertake is named Tomb Raiders. This of course is a nod to the Tomb Raider franchise starring Lara Croft. Another non-Ubisoft title reference is for The Secret of Monkey Island. A pirate by the name of Mancomb Seepgood appears later in the game and is a reference to the classic point and click adventure.</p><p>When it comes to Ubisoft made titles, Assassin’s Creed 4 include references to Watch Dogs and Splinter Cell. There might be more hidden gems in the game and it’s always worth playing the second time around.</p><h2 id=8-inside-abstergo-entertainment><strong>8. Inside Abstergo Entertainment</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the Assassin’s Creed universe, Abstergo Entertainment is basically a game developer that uses the Animus to create games. Like most game devs, Abstergo Entertainment’s HQ is filled with a ton of memorabilia from their previous titles. In this case, Abstergo Entertainment’s HQ calls out to the past Assassin’s Creed entries.</p><p>In Assassin’s Creed 4, the player gets a glimpse inside Abstergo Entertainment’s Montreal studio early on in the game. Inside the HQ is a ton of direct references to past entries in the series. It was surely a treasure trove for those who’ve been following the game since the beginning.</p><p>Inside Olivier Garneau’s office is glass case with a few interesting weapons. One of which is a Syrian Sabre; which is clearly referencing to Assassin’s Creed 1, Maria Auditore’s dagger and a few double barrelled shotguns. These shotguns are from Ubisoft’s other title, Red Steel 2.</p><h2 id=7-giant-squid><strong>7. Giant Squid</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As unrealistic as the Assassin’s Creed series may be, let’s at least credit the fact that Ubisoft didn’t introduce any oddball ideas like monsters and demons to the game. The assassin’s are always faced with all too human enemies but in one particular easter egg, Assassin’s Creed 2’s Ezio almost came in contact with a giant squid.</p><p>When Ezio enters the Assassin Tomb beneath Santa Maria della Visitazione, things look pretty normal. However when Ezio pulls a lever lowering swinging poles and looked into the water near the lever for a good minute or so, players will be treated to a pretty neat cutscene featuring Ezio and the giant squid.</p><p>For the first time, the giant squid will be seen swimming by. But if Ezio pulled the lever again and looked at the water for a second time, one of the giant Squid’s tentacles will try to attack Ezio in a cutscene. Lucky for us, Ezio’s assassin reflexes avoided major combat with the monstrosity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-hello-world><strong>6. Hello World!</strong></h2><p>www.stackoverflow.com</p><p>Ubisoft added this neat Easter Egg for geeks and programmers alike. The world of Assassin’s Creed is set in the modern times. Thanks to the Animus, players get to control dangerous assassins like Ezio, Altair and many more, the Animus isn’t a miracle though. It’s a very advanced program that’s also made up of codes.</p><p>During the very first sequence of Assassin’s Creed Revelations, Subject 16 talked to Desmond Males about Animus Island. What it is, is a test world created by the developers of Animus to help further understand the tech. After talking about Animus Island, Subject 16 proclaims, “Hello World!”</p><p>For those not familiar with programming, “Hello World!” is the most common test program that’s made to introduce would-be programmers to the basics of programming. It’s neat Easter Egg that not many may have gotten the first time around but we thank Ubisoft for this really great callout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-more-mario-references><strong>5. More Mario References!</strong></h2><p></p><p>Super Mario is definitely one of the most popular video game characters out there. It shouldn’t be a surprise anymore if players see easter eggs regarding the Italian plumber. Assassin’s Creed 2 was set in Italy but Ubisoft didn’t grab the opportunity for numerous Mario Easter Eggs. However, Ubisoft made due with the references in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood.</p><p>In the mission titled “Femme Fatale,” a not-so-subtle reference to Super Mario is heard when taking Lucreza Borgia to Caterina Sforza’s cell. Lucrezia comments “rescuing princesses from castles now?” Along with this is another Easter Egg in the form of an achievement called Prinsepessa In Another Castello.</p><p>Another neat reference to Super Mario was the Plumber achievement. This achievement’s icon is actually the Warp Pipe from the Mario series. It’s no surprise that Ubisoft pulled out all stops when referencing Super Mario in a game set in Italy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-turkey-and-the-konami-code><strong>4. Turkey And The Konami Code</strong></h2><p></p><p>At any time after Sequence 6, Assassin’s Creed 3’s Connor can be accompanied by a turkey anytime. The turkey is no help in Connor’s journey of course but it’s a pretty nice companion to have. It’s serves more of a comic relief rather than a useful companion in the game.</p><p>To get a hold of the clingy turkey, players will first need to travel to Davenport Homestead. Once there, they should look for any cover to get behind and whistle. After whistling, the turkey will appear behind Connor like it’s usual for turkeys to come after whistling. The Easter Egg doesn’t stop there, if players input the Konami code anytime after getting the turkey, Connor will feed it. The Konami code for each console version is as follows:</p><p>Xbox 360: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A.</p><p>PS3: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, O, X.</p><p>PC: 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, E, Space.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-the-headless-horseman-of-sleepy-hollow><strong>3. The Headless Horseman Of Sleepy Hollow</strong></h2><p></p><p>In one of Assassin’s Creed Rogue’s most exciting encounters, players can face off against the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. If players go Sleepy Hollow in the Albany region of the River Valley will attack the player. He’s exactly at the Old Dutch Church.</p><p>The Headless Horseman can be killed. It has the same animations as a Brute and wields a large axe. Also in the arsenal of the Headless Horseman is a large axe, a pistol and grenade. Killing this enemy requires a few tricks though as direct attacks to it won’t do any good.</p><p>There are a few ways to kill the horseman: Shoot a pumpkin in the cemetery next to the church, use a sleep grenade so that it drops it axe which can then be used to kill it, hang it using a rope dart, or a&nbsp;haystack assassination.</p><h2 id=2-lovecraftian-sightings><strong>2. Lovecraftian Sightings</strong></h2><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>H.P. Lovecraft’s creations are often seen a bunch of time in other video games. Perhaps the most popular of the horror author’s creations is the infamous Cthulhu. This terrifying creature does not appear in any of the Assassin’s Creed games per se, but Assassin’s Creed Unity does nod to the deity a few times.</p><p>First off, one set of brass knuckles in the game is called “Great Old One’s Caress.” It’s a reference to the Cthulhu mythos so Lovecratian fans are sure to spot this one immediately. It refers to the term “Great Old One,” who are space-faring deities that once roamed the earth.</p><p>Moreover, the knuckles are shaped like a tentacle which is synonymous to Cthulhu himself. Lastly, the description of the weapon writes were “hupadgh n'gha ng n'ghft” which translates to “were born of death and darkness.” The language used in the description is called R’lyehian, the language of the Great Old Ones.</p><h2 id=1-historical-accuracies><strong>1. Historical Accuracies</strong></h2><p>www.ubisoft.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The games in the Assassin’s Creed series take place across different time periods in history. Assassin’s Creed 2, for example, takes place in Italy during the Renaissance period. Ubisoft took the opportunity to place in a few historical accuracies in the game and history buffs definitely enjoyed Assassin’s Creed 2 and Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood.</p><p>From characters to places, Assassin’s Creed 2 and Brotherhood aren’t short of nods to history. One of the main characters in the two titles is the actual Leonardo Da Vinci. In the game, Da Vinci was seen being under the employ of Cesare Borgia. This actually happened in real life as the inventor was employed by Borgia as a military architect and engineer. There are more historical accuracies in Assassin’s Creed 2 and Brotherhood and sometimes it’s best to play the game with a history book at hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2arrTAxKtknp%2BXqHq6u9RmpKKro5qxbrXNZpisq5GowKq60maaq52VmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-james-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler James Williams News - Us Weekly</span></a>
