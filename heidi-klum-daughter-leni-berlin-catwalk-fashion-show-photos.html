Leni, who is Heidi’s daughter with <strong>Flavio Briatore</strong> but raised by <strong>Seal</strong>, rocked her hair slicked back for an on-trend wet look. She kept the vibe going with her glowing, ultra-dewy skin and slightly glossy nude lip. Ahead of the event, Leni sported the same ensemble as she posed for photographers on a step-and-repeat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/heidi-klum-daughter-leni-shutterstock-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Despite her young age, Leni has already hit a number of career highs: she made her&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue&nbsp;debut on a joint cover</a> with her mom Heidi in December 2020 on the brand’s German edition. The mother-daughter duo twinned in colorful suits that were slightly oversized, paying homage to the late ’80s and early ’90s. Heidi sweetly kissed her eldest daughter on the cheek as Leni confidently stared right at the camera, giving her best model pose. Just months later, the teen appeared solo on a cover of the German Glamour — likely just the start of many covers to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/heidi-klum-daughter-leni-shutterstock-post-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>As part of Heidi and Leni’s&nbsp;Vogue feature, the former <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Victoria’s Secret Angel</a> wrote a letter to her daughter filled with advice as she pursues her modeling career. Heidi described the teen as “a really great person with your heart in the right place,” urging&nbsp; her to “always carry what I have given you over the past 16 years…for the big decisions in life, but also for the very little ones.” She added, “and even if you often don’t want to hear your mom’s clever advice, here’s another one: never do something you don’t want to do and always listen to your gut instinct.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BrZqGdmZm2brfLrqRmnJGqtKnAxKtkpZ2ennqjsdGloKdlk5bBuK3LpGSfmaOdtrC6jKyfqK9dpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-about-ana-paula-marlon-vera-daughter-the-mma-fighter-family-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>All About Ana Paula | Marlon Vera Daughter: The MMA Fighter Family And Net Worth</span></a>
