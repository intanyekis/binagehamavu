On December 28, 1989, Sean broke into Madonna's Malibu house, where she was home alone. Madonna attempted to leave, but Sean reportedly tied her up to a chair with twine and an electrical cord. Penn verbally and physically abused her for hours, while taking swigs of liquor out of a bottle. He left the house to get more alcohol and returned a little while later to continue the abuse. After a total of nine hours, Penn untied Madonna after she agreed to perform a sexual act on him. She fled the house to her vehicle and locked herself in the car, while calling the police.
