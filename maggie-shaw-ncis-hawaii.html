Played by recurring guest star Julie White, Maggie Shaw is a CIA agent and Jane Tennant’s longtime mentor. She first appeared during the Season 1 episode “The Tourist” and continued to pop up on the show.</p><p>Maggie was last season during Season 2 finale, which ended with her going on the run. She returned during the last couple minutes of&nbsp; the Season 3 finale. After neutralizing a bioweapon threat, Tennant returned home, expecting see her daughter Julie. Instead, Maggie was sitting at her kitchen table. “No, Janey. Julie isn’t here,” Maggie said. “And you’re probably going to need a drink for what’s coming next….”</p><p>The ominous message could have been about anything, from a new threat to something related to their past in the CIA. Either way, fans were devastated that the show ended on a cliffhanger, and they may never find out what Maggie was going to tell Tennant. Several viewers expressed their frustration with the ending on social media, with one fan writing on<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> X (formerly Twitter)</a>: “<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Not #NCISHawaii</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> ending like that after a strike shortened season and the cancellation</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">. Safe to say it was not filmed with said cancellation in mind.” Another angry viewer wrote: “So @CBS </span>you didn’t renew #NCISHawii for another season, but ended Season 3 on a cliffhanger???? SERIOUSLY!!! With that ending you don’t renew????!!!!??” A third fan chimed in: “<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">You cannot leave me on a cliffhanger, this is a heinous crime @CBS #NCISHawaii #SaveNCISHawii.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a>, fans argued that the scene should have been cut, which would have allowed the show to end on the team’s champagne toast the scene prior. “It was the final slap in the face from CBS,” one user wrote. Another noted that perhaps the cliffhanger was left in to boost viewership and save the show. “I like the cliff hanger if you’re thinking and hoping for the viewership to be high enough to force CBS to change there mind,” they wrote.</p><p>CBS could potentially reverse their decision if the fan outcry is loud enough. The network did so for Shemar Moore’s <a href=# rel=noopener>S.W.A.T. on two separate occasions</a>, and fans are already rallying around the series.</p><p>The showrunners have yet to speak out about the cliffhanger, but Steven Binder, co-showrunner of the mothership, said the cancellation was “personally tough” for him. “Their devastation is my devastation,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TheWrap</a>. “I think it was a victim of a perfect storm of a changing industry … I don’t think it would have been canceled any other season. It didn’t go down because it was unsuccessful, it was a must-watch show and people liked it. It got a lot of numbers.”</p><p>NCIS: Hawai’i is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on NCIS, check out who the <a href=# rel=noopener>cast is married to or dating in real life in the gallery below</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYm6EdX2Oppign5maerS0wLBkp5uZqHqprdaaoKJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maria-brink.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Maria Brink dating?
