Stay tuned to find out more about her towards the conclusion.</strong></p><p>Lauren, the scion of a shady dynasty, is accused of brutally killing an 87-year-old singing instructor in Chelsea. Before the charge, Lauren was a fashionable woman in New York City.</p><p>Lauren Pazienza, 26, grew up in a lovely part of Long Island, where her father, Daniel, runs a successful Holtsville business that was once named the finest cesspool service in Suffolk County in terms of both price and quality of service.</p><p>After moving to the Big Apple, Pazienza—a former events manager for an upscale French furniture company—was seen having fun in the city, going to swanky parties and establishing art galleries.</p><p>She and her fiancé live in a luxurious apartment in Astoria, but some of the neighbors say she wasn’t always happy there. Let’s find out more about Lauren Pazienza’s weight gain journey since it’s been a topic of discussion.</p><p>Many Redditors speculated that the food supplied in Lauren Pazienza’s prison contributed to her significant weight gain.</p><p>One of them claims that the canteen sells sugary junk food and that the prison only serves starchy, high-carb meals. Lauren may have put on a lot of weight after living off of it for more than a year.</p><p>She seems so big; there has to be a reason for it.</p><h2>Weight Gain Journey of Lauren Pazienza: Before and After Pictures</h2><p>The reasons behind Lauren Pazeinza’s dramatic weight increase are up for debate since it has altered her appearance. The public thinks that she ate a lot of prison food, which is why she put on so much weight.</p><p>To make a long story short, Lauren Pazienza handed herself into the NYPD in March 2022 about the death of an elderly lady.</p><p>She pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and tried to get a $500k bail. However, once her bail was canceled, she was sent to jail. She’s been a prisoner on Rikers Island ever since.</p><p>She has now raised her voice to change her request. During that legal procedure, she submitted a guilty plea, making her remarkable weight increase public.</p><p>They saw how much bigger she seemed than she did before, and they couldn’t help but talk about the noticeable change in her appearance.</p><p>Her substantial weight increase caught them off guard more than her guilty plea. To be honest, her latest request did not come as a huge surprise to anybody.</p><p>A compelling case made by the prosecution and video evidence led many people to believe that Lauren Pazienza was the cause of Barbara Gustern’s death.</p><h2>More Information About Her Abrupt Weight Gain</h2><p>A few audience members speculated that Lauren Pazienza’s weight gain may be a regular side effect of her depressive medication.</p><p>They surmise that she may have been given medicine while in custody. There is another school of thought that claims she gained weight as a coping mechanism.</p><p>It seems that women incarcerated like packing on as much muscle as they can to make sure no one will bother them.</p><p>Some individuals ignored their sentiments for Lauren Pazienza and began to conjecture about the reasons behind her weight increase, while others decided to show more emotion.</p><p>They were pleased that she had put on weight, grown so big that her legs resembled tree trunks, and resembled the people she had insulted (not that she deserved pity; she murdered an elderly lady after attacking her without warning).</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086081,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>singing instructor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>James Gunn Controversy And Scandal: Why Was He Fired From Galaxy Vol. 3?</a></h3>The James Gunn controversy spurred a lot of conversation about how responsibility is changing in the entertainment sector.Renowned American director and studio executive James Gunn is well-known f <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Dana Hyde Kids With Her Husband Jonathan Chambers | Family And Net Worth Before Death</a></h3>Officials believe that the disaster that killed a well-known DC attorney last week when they were on board a business plane suffering high turbulence was caused by stability difficulties.
