During an appearance on the&nbsp;Today&nbsp;show on Tuesday, co-anchor&nbsp;Hoda Kotb&nbsp;asked Fonda and&nbsp;Lily Tomlin&nbsp;about their longtime friendship.
After Fonda said the two had known each other for 50 years, Tomlin quipped: “I think before your first face-lift!”
While Kotb and&nbsp;Savannah Guthrie&nbsp;cracked up at the comment, Fonda, 80, was less amused. “We don’t need to hear that,” she said."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
