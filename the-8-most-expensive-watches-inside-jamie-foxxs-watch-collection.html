A talented musician from the start, he worked hard at school and excelled in sports and academics to earn a scholarship for studying music. Foxx was also an entertainer at heart and first began his stand-up comedy career and released multiple specials. He soon pivoted toward making comedy movies and using his musical talents to release music. The early 1990s and 2000s saw Foxx dominate both industries and even win an Oscar for his lead performance as the titular character in <i>Ray</i>. <a href=#>The artist amassed a hefty $170 million fortune</a> through his music and movies.</p><p>Growing up in a small home, Jamie Foxx knew the value of his hard work and invested his money in multiple ventures. The actor is also known to make expensive real estate and automobile purchases. He is often seen wearing a blingy watch on his wrist that costs a lot more than a few hundred thousand dollars.
