From the caped crusader Batman to the man of steel himself, Superman, these heroes have captured the imagination of audiences around the world for generations. But which of these movies has been the most successful at the box office? This article takes a look at the 10 highest-grossing DCU movies of all time and ranks them based on their worldwide <a href=#>box office earnings</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wonder-woman-1984-2020---169-6-million>Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) - $169.6 Million</h2><p>Although Wonder Woman 1984 was considered a box office disappointment due to its release during a global pandemic, some argue that its performance was not a complete failure. While the movie only made $169.6 million worldwide, which fell short of its $200 million production budget, it should be noted that its release strategy as the first of Warner Bros.' day-and-date release experiments made a difference. As the film was made available on HBO Max simultaneously with its theatrical release, it drew in more subscribers to the streaming platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birds-of-prey-2020---201-8-million>Birds Of Prey (2020) - $201.8 Million</h2><p>Similar to Wonder Woman 1984 and The Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey is another DCU movie that failed to recoup its budget, but this time without the pandemic as an excuse. Although the movie had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">production budget of $100 million</a>, typically matched by marketing expenses, and despite box office returns after movie theater fees, the film is still in the red. However, the 2020 movie may have been the least deserving of its box office underperformance, given its bold risks. The film deserved better success than it received.</p><h2 id=shazam-2019---365-9-million>Shazam! (2019) - $365.9 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Shazam didn't hit the billion-dollar mark, earning only $365.9 million, it was still considered a significant success for Warner Bros, particularly given that the superhero was relatively unknown to most audiences. The 2019 film revitalized the predictable superhero formula by adopting an approach reminiscent of 80s family movies and featuring clever references to other heroes in the DC Universe, making its triumph all but inevitable. Many believe that Shazam is, in fact, <a href=#>the best DCU movie</a>. In this regard, Fury of the Gods, its sequel, has the potential to be even more successful.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Oscar-Winning Movies Of All Time, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=black-adam-2022---391-3-million>Black Adam (2022) - $391.3 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not being the lowest-grossing DCU film, Black Adam's $200 million budget did not translate into financial success. The movie featured Dwayne Johnson in the titular role and Henry Cavill's return as Superman, but these star-studded performances failed to compete with the much-anticipated arrival of the MCU's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Moreover, Black Adam ranks among the lower-rated DCU films on Rotten Tomatoes, and spoilers for the significant post-credits scene might have hindered the hype needed to make it a breakout hit.</p><h2 id=justice-league-2017---657-9-million>Justice League (2017) - $657.9 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite grossing $657.9 million, <a href=#>Justice League</a> was not considered a successful film due to its exorbitant production budget, estimated to be around $300 million or more due to extensive reshoots. As a team-up movie featuring Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman - all of whom had individual films that grossed significantly more - Warner Bros. was likely expecting a much higher box office figure. Even the film's star, Ben Affleck, was reluctant to discuss it, signaling a clear red flag. Nevertheless, the movie did give rise to the hilarious "sad Affleck" meme.</p><h2 id=man-of-steel-2013---668-million>Man Of Steel (2013) - $668 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released in 2013, Man of Steel was the first film in the DCU and remains a favorite among many fans, despite changes to the franchise since its release. It was a risky move to depict <a href=#>Superman in a dark and gritty way</a>, but it paid off with a unique and memorable take on the character. However, while it was not a box office bomb like Justice League, Man of Steel's gross of $668 million fell short of expectations.</p><h2 id=suicide-squad-2016---746-8-million>Suicide Squad (2016) - $746.8 Million</h2><p>Suicide Squad's box office performance was a fascinating success story. Despite being one of the most critically panned movies in recent years, it still managed to gross almost $750 million. The film not only became David Ayer's highest-grossing movie but also one of the most profitable films in the DCU. Despite the film's troubled production, including extensive reshoots and edits, the general audience was drawn to the star power of Will Smith and the debut of Margot Robbie as the beloved character Harley Quinn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Keanu Reeves Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=wonder-woman-2017---822-8-million>Wonder Woman (2017) - $822.8 Million</h2><p>After the rough start with Man of Steel, the <a href=#>DC Universe</a> found its footing in 2017 with Wonder Woman, which received widespread critical acclaim. The movie's success can be attributed to positive word-of-mouth and the hype built around the character's solo adventure following her introduction in a previous film. A unique blend of a period war drama and a superhero epic, Wonder Woman proved to be a crowd-pleaser and is considered one of the most enjoyable movies in the genre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016---863-6-million>Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) - $863.6 Million</h2><p>Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a highly anticipated movie that ended up being one of the most controversial superhero films of all time. While it earned a considerable amount of money at the box office, it couldn't shake the perception of being a financial disappointment, especially when compared to the potential earnings it could have generated. The film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from a significant decline</a> in its second weekend, and it failed to match the long-term box office success of its Marvel Cinematic Universe competitor, Captain America: Civil War.</p><h2 id=aquaman-2018---1-148-billion>Aquaman (2018) - $1.148 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surprisingly, in a film universe that features iconic superheroes like Batman and Superman, it was Aquaman that smashed the billion-dollar box office mark. This is particularly impressive considering the character's reputation amongst comic fans for having silly abilities, a goofy appearance, and riding a seahorse. Nevertheless, transforming him into a cool, tough, surfer-type proved to be a major success. With Jason Momoa's magnetic performance in the lead and James Wan's skilled direction, <a href=#>Aquaman</a> emerged as the DC Universe's most unexpected hit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'John Wick: Chapter 4', Ranked</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Trends</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ydmq5lnaTDqrHSZqmappuasXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neighbor-stops-kim-kardashian-from-building-an-underground-vault-other-renos-in-her-la-home.html><span>←</span><span>Neighbor Stops Kim Kardashian From Building An Underground Vault &amp;amp; Other Renos In Her LA Home</span></a>
