The South African comedian announced his decision in an emotional monologue to his live audience, who had no inkling about it beforehand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve loved hosting this show. It’s been one of my greatest challenges. It’s been one of my greatest joys. I’ve loved trying to figure out how to make people laugh even when the stories are particularly sh*tty on the worst days,” Noah said in his statement.</p><p>This is definitely a very transitional period for the 38-year-old, who also recently <a href=#>split up with his girlfriend Minka Kelly</a>. The two had been in something of an on-and-off relationship for the last two years or so, but are now believed to be “totally over.”</p><p>Noah is said to have been <a href=#>earning up to $8 million a year</a> in his job as host of The Daily Show, a salary which has helped him amass an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $100 million</a>.</p><p>As he looks forward to his next adventure, Comedy Central is left to fill in the void he leaves behind. Here are some candidates who might stand a good chance of replacing him in the main chair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Minka Kelly Has Been Up To Since Her Split With Trevor Noah</a></span></p><h2 id=roy-wood-jr><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Roy Wood Jr.</span></h2><p>Roy Wood Jr. has been a senior correspondent on The Daily Show for as long as Trevor Noah has been host. He is already being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned as one of the favorites to step up</a> into the big seat once his boss leaves.</p><p>If Noah gets the opportunity to anoint his successor as he was by Jon Stewart, Wood has every reason to fancy his chances.</p><h2 id=dulc-eacute-sloan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dulcé Sloan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another in-house possibility for Trevor Noah’s replacement is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dulcé Sloan, The Daily Show’s Senior Fashion Correspondent</a>. She has been in the role since September 2017.</p><p>Sloan might be a slightly longer shot than Roy Wood Jr., considering seniority and longevity on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Trevor Noah Wants A Squad Like Tom Holland’s</a></span></p><h2 id=ronny-chieng><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ronny Chieng</span></h2><p>Ronny Chieng is also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of Trevor Noah’s underlings</a>, and might feel he also has a chance at being selected to replace him. The Malaysian star arrived at The Daily Show about a month after Noah, and is also a senior correspondent.</p><p>Chieng could be considered a serious outsider for the big gig, but so was Noah when Stewart hand-picked him in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=desi-lydic><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Desi Lydic</span></h2><p>Completing the line-up of Trevor Noah’s current senior correspondents on this list is Desi Lydic, who has also been on his team since the very beginning.</p><p>The Kentucky-born comedian and actor has had experience hosting her own segment on The Daily Show, titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What The Actual Fact?</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Little-Known Facts About Trevor Noah's Comedy Career</a></span></p><h2 id=jordan-klepper><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jordan Klepper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan Klepper worked with Trevor Noah for about two years before he left, and experienced being in charge of his own shows.</p><p>After the end of The Opposition with Jordan Klepper and Klepper, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">returned to The Daily Show</a> in December 2019.</p><h2 id=hassan-minhaj><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hassan Minhaj</span></h2><p>Going a little bit further back in The Daily Show history, Hassan Minhaj’s time on the program preceded Trevor Noah’s debut. He did overlap with the new host, however, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually left in 2018</a>.</p><p>Minhaj’s vast experience away from the Comedy Central series makes him a strong candidate to take over from Noah.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Netflix's Happier Hour Features Hassan Minhaj and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-ruffin><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Amber Ruffin</span></h2><p>Amber Ruffin has never worked on The Daily Show, but would make a standout contender to be the new boss after Trevor Noah.</p><p>The comedian currently <a href=#>hosts her own late night talk show</a>, titled The Amber Ruffin Show on Peacock. She has also <a href=#>previously worked with Seth Meyers</a> on Late Night with Seth Meyers.</p><h2 id=samantha-bee><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Samantha Bee</span></h2><p>Like Amber Ruffin, Samantha Bee is also an experienced late night show host, with her Full Frontal with Samantha Bee on TBS. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The show was recently canceled</a>, which might just make for perfect timing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bee was also a correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart between 2003 and 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Samantha Bee Responds To Tom Hanks’ Statement On Mask Hysteria: ‘How Dare We’</a></span></p><h2 id=andy-cohen><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Andy Cohen</span></h2><p>In the more wildcard segment of this list, experienced host Andy Cohen could be a candidate to take over The Daily Show from Trevor Noah.</p><p>At 54 years old, Cohen would bring his knowhow from working in Love Connection, the Real Housewives franchise and <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live!, his late-night talk show</a> on Bravo network.</p><h2 id=loyiso-gola><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Loyiso Gola</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another completely left-field candidate would be Trevor Noah’s compatriot, Loyiso Gola. The comedian is well known and established across Africa, and even has a special on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>, titled Unlearning.</p><p>An appointment for Gola would practically be hoping for lightning to strike twice, after Noah was plucked out of relative global obscurity before him, to become the main man on The Daily Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqaUnrGiwMSsZLCgn2KwsMHLnWSrnaChrqSxjK2pnq6fp3qvu8ChZKimXam1pnnDmqClsV2otbDDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-daughters-dress-up-the-godfather-dinner-party-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Tim McGraw, Faith Hill &amp;amp; Daughters Dress Up For The Godfather Party Hollywood Life</span></a>
