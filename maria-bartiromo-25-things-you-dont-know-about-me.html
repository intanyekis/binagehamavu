Read on to learn 25 things about the Mornings With Maria anchor.</p><p>1. I played the accordion growing up. Can’t say I know how to play anymore, though.</p><p>2. My grandfather came to America aboard a boat called The Rex. Years later, he opened a restaurant in Brooklyn called The Rex Manor.</p><p>3. One of my first jobs was as a stock girl at Kleinfeld’s bridal store in Brooklyn. I’d try on all the dresses and veils. My boss walked in on me, and she told me to come back when I was serious about working.</p><p>4. I cried the whole way home, but I learned a valuable lesson early — do your job!</p><p>5. I am big into wellness, and every winter I take a trip to Arizona to hike the mountains. It’s one of my favorite things to do.</p><p>6. I also love biking and yoga.</p><p>7. My first job in TV was as an intern at CNN.</p><p>8. I worked at CNBC when I was 24, and was the first person ever to report live from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>9. I was born and raised in Brooklyn. Now I live within 15 miles of where I grew up.</p><p>10. I’m the youngest of three. I have a sister and a brother.</p><p>11. My Maltese, Ella Bella, passed away last summer. I miss her so much. Soon I’ll have to get another dog, but it’s hard to believe anyone can fill Ella’s paws.</p><p>12. I have for years collected signed currency from treasury secretaries.</p><p>13. I’m close with my parents and speak to them all the time.</p><p>14. I’ve played myself against Hollywood greats like <strong>Michael Douglas</strong> in Wall Street II and<strong> Richard Gere</strong> in Arbitrage.</p><p>15. I was also in another <strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong> movie, Megalopolis, that never made it — but I had so much fun filming.</p><p>16. My dad is a chef and comes over most weekends. We cook together.</p><p>17. My favorite movie of all time is The Sound of Music. It makes me happy. A close second is Rear Window.</p><p>18. Joey Ramone of The Ramones wrote a song about me [“Maria Bartiromo”]. I got to know him before he died and can tell you that he was an avid investor. I love that song and will always be grateful.</p><p>19. My nickname growing up was Bullet because I was the fastest runner on the block.</p><p>20. I work really long hours, but I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.</p><p>21. I anchor news programs 17 hours a week, across six days and two networks.</p><p>22. My favorite quotes are “If you want something done, give it to a busy woman” and Maya Angelou’s “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.”</p><p>23. I’ve toyed with starting a TV show to teach kids about money.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I used to save all my coins in a jar to buy ice cream cones from Mr. Softee. It taught me early on the value in saving.</p><p>25. I am having the most fun I’ve ever had in my career — I love my show and colleagues. It’s the reason I don’t mind waking up at 3 a.m. every day!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKerm6uwKuroqqforxufpRmq6GhnpzAbsXOrmSdp56peqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuucRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacob-hoggard-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jacob Hoggard Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
