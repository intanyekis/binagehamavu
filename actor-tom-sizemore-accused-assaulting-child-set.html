However, this is the first time a then child actress has come forward to accuse her assaulter.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, the now 26-year-old actress, who wished to remain anonymous for the article but will be pressing charges, hired a lawyer to take legal action against Sizemore, who she says touched her inappropriately on a Utah film set.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>ALIGATIONS PILE UP AGAINST KEVIN SPACEY</a></strong></p><p>In 2003, Sizemore was playing the role of the father in the movie <i>Born Killers</i> (not to be confused with Natural Born Killers, the 1994 <a href=#>Oliver Stone</a> movie that Sizemore was also a part of). The movie was about two reckless brothers on a crime spree, and Sizemore played their immoral father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The incident took place near the end of production of <i>Born Killers</i> during a second-unit still portrait session for photos of Sizemore's character with his abandoned wife and daughter. The daughter was played by an 11-year-old wearing a flannel nightgown. The 30-minute photo shoot required her to sit in Sizemore’s lap in a holiday tableau. It was during those 30-minutes when the assault occurred.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>CELEBRITIES OUTED FOR HARASSMENT</a></strong></p><p>"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited,” said actress Robyn Adamson, who portrayed Sizemore’s wife in the movie. “I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was."</p><p>“The girl was so young it was unclear to her and her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not," recalled production manager Cassidy Lunnen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Word eventually reached the casting director, who filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild’s legal department to immediately remove Sizemore from the set. SAG has not yet replied to requests for comment.</p><p>When the film’s producers reviewed the film taken of that day they found the photos to be inconclusive. This, combined with the fact the actress's parents refused to press charges, meant that Sizemore was allowed back on set for reshoots a few months later.</p><p>Sizemore has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and has been convicted of assaulting his ex-girlfriend resulting in 36 months probation as well as being required to complete a year-long domestic abuse program.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>OTHER 'KEVIN SPACYS' IN HOLLYWOOD</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yir9OoqWasn6J6tLXZnqSoqpVirqSv1KycnWWRqMCiwcutoKefXZi1qrjDZqqerF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-sources-crossword-clue-nyt-99928498.html><span>←</span><span>20 sources Crossword Clue NYT</span></a>
