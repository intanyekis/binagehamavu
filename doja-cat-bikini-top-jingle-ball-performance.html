The singer showed off her flawless figure in a crystal-covered bikini top and sheer cream pants as she was flanked by her backup dancers. She paired the sassy look with a diamond choker and a set of sparkling earrings as she belted out <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her favorite tunes</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doja-cat-jingle-ball-ss-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The “Kiss Me More” hitmaker added a diamond arm cuff to her ensemble as well, which matched her glittery nail polish. Her auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders as she danced around on the holiday-themed stage. Accentuating the glamourous look, Doja wore a smokey eye and deep red lipstick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doja-cat-jingle-ball-ss-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Apparently, the holidays bring out the sexiness in the singer. At this year’s CarnEvil Halloween Party event in Los Angeles, Doja dressed as a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sultry version of Miss Sara Bellum</a> from The Cartoon Network series&nbsp;Powerpuff Girls. The plunging neckline of her bright red blazer showed off her cleavage as she paired the seductive style with a red mini skirt with a black belt. She rocked long, red-painted finger nails, a black bralette and killer black high heels. The whole provocative look was topped off with a red lipstick and heavy mascara.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doja-cat-jingle-ball-ss-post-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Doja has become a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>powerhouse on the music scene</a> with hits like “Say So” and “Best Friend.” During an interview with <strong>Missy Elliot,</strong> she explained what inspires her style. “Even though I was born in 1995, I’m stuck in 2010, or 2004. I feel like I need to revamp my sound, but I’m also having a lot of fun, so f*** it, who cares?” she said to the legendary rapper for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Interview</a>. “I’m good, and I can be funny and charming, and I can do little punchlines here and there, but I need to talk about my life more, and about what’s going on … there’s personal stuff that happens in my life that I don’t talk about in my music,” she continued. “I also kind of don’t care.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49tZp2nmpZ6pK3TZpmio5mjtm7Azqlko6GenLmmecGao6VloJq%2Fp7vRppinm5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vince-papale-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Vince Papale Net Worth How Much Is Vince Papale Worth?</span></a>
