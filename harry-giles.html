Giles went 7-for-13 from the field and showed some good defense from time to time on the Clippers’ bigs.</p><p><b>Fantasy Impact:</b></p><p>Giles will take over the “Marvin Bagley” role for the Kings as Bagley will likely be out for at least a couple of weeks. In the two games that Bagley was absent, Giles has scored 15 and 18 points respectively while also shooting 57.5% from the field.
