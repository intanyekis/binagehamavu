Thieves were reportedly able to make away with $20,000 in clothing taken directly from the actor’s Los Angeles home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the perpetrators were able to access Piven’s home by smashing a window. Piven was not home at the time of the robbery. Rather, his representative told the outlet he’s currently in the United Kingdom performing stand-up comedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Harrison Proposes To Lauren Zima With A $100,000 Ring</a></span></p><p>No arrests have been made in the case, but police are asking for the public’s help in finding footage that can assist them in identifying those responsible for the crime. At this time, it’s also unclear if Piven’s home was targeted or if the home robbery was done at random.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9Honey Celebrity</a> reports that he bought the Hollywood Hills home in 2017 for $7 million. The mansion has a view of downtown LA as well as the Pacific Ocean and has features like glass walls and infinity pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It hasn’t been confirmed if Piven will return to the United States following the theft. He made his stand-up debut earlier this month in the U.K. on October 15th.</p><p>He previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunday Express</a> that it was important to have his first shows in London, saying, “I know how much comedy means to the UK. There are no harsher critics than the Brits.” He added that sarcasm isn’t understood well in America, rather, it’s better received in the United Kingdom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, theft is nothing new in the celebrity world. This year alone, several high-profile celebrities have had personal items stolen. In May, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported</a> that three storage units belonging to Beyonce’s production company, Parkwood Entertainment, were broken into. The robbers managed to take $1 million in accessories and clothing.</p><p>Earlier in January, Miley Cyrus also had a storage locker broken into. Those responsible took an assortment of personal items, including clothes and family photos, though a dollar amount for the robbery wasn’t made public. It appeared Miley wasn’t specifically targeted in the theft, as other storage units were also hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shawn Mendes and Camilla Cabello also got a fright in March when thieves targeted their Los Angeles mansion, though they were home at the time. The perpetrators reportedly left quickly upon realizing people were in the house, but they took off with Shawn’s G-wagon, which generally start at a minimum of $120,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Adele Is Releasing A New Album Inspired By Her Divorce</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>9Honey Celebrity</a>, <a href=#>Sunday Express</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3pr7EprBmqJmrsq%2B%2FjKGmrquVYsSiv4yrppualZl6uLXToWRraJtixLC%2B06FkqJ5dmLmwwMeipaBlo6m8rbHNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-about-tj-hunt-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>All About TJ Hunt | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
