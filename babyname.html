Willow trees are associated with grace and elegance, which gave way to the adjective "willowy." Other names with meanings related to willows include Arava, Willoughby, Dozier, Wellesley, Selby, and Salton.<p>An ancient tree that figures in literature from Shakespeare to Harry Potter and is believed to possess magical powers, Willow is a lovely name, as graceful as its inspiration, that is growing in popularity along with Willa and Will.</p><p>This elegant and charming nature name has been chosen for their daughters by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Monaghan and Pink. It's been a fast riser in recent years, climbing along with other Will names Willa, William and Will, having taken off here a year after the character of Willow was introduced on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 1997.</p><p>Willow is even more popular in other English-speaking countries: it's highly popular in Australia and in the UK, Canada and Scotland.</p><p>The name has transcended its one-time hippie aura to move into the realm of reappraised and appreciated <a href=#>nature names</a>. The willow is believed by the Romani to possess the ability to heal the sick and rejuvenate the aged.</p><p>Pink was quoted as saying her choice was influenced by a willow tree she grew up near, and that it is the most flexible tree that nothing can break—no wind, no elements, it can bend and withstand anything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkaKyo7HRq7Bnm5%2BifKOtwbKlmqWVZMSquMuormifmae5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-not-backing-down-cobra-remix-by-blanca.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Not Backing Down (COBRA Remix) by Blanca</span></a>
