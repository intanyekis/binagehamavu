Some sources, however, claim the defensive end is set to receive a four-year contract worth over <strong>$5million </strong>with h guaranteed signing&nbsp;bonus of <strong>$1.4million. </strong>The second-round selection is going to have some possible advantages for the Buffalo Bills' rookie.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playerswiki.com//uploads/2021/05/07/carlos-basham-jr-1620363819.jpg width=480 height=320 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption> Carlos Basham Jr was drafted by the Bills in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft.</span><span class=imageSource> SOURCE: Buffalo Bills</span><p>Analytics and other forms of empirical data suggest if the 6 foot 5 defensive end meets the standard of the NFL or his new team doesn't cut him, he could be pulling in around $1 million a year whilst playing for the Buffalo Bills.&nbsp;</p><h2>Carlos Basham Girlfriend, Personal Life</h2><p>Basham seems to be single for now; someone who looks like choosing to stand on his own - especially when it comes to making a partner. There's a good chance Basham's fans must be curious about his love life - given the fact that he has now become a more recognizable figure. And all the last few days have made him more important. It could be that the footballer is yet to hit a touchdown when it comes to finding his right one.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playerswiki.com//uploads/2021/05/07/carlos-basham-jr-1620363965.png width=480 height=344 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Carlos Basham Jr played collegiate football for Wake Forrest University</span><span class=imageSource> SOURCE: Instagram</span><p>Also one cannot ignore the notion that dating an NFL star takes a bit more effort and not everyone's up for it. While it could be an adventure to be an athlete's better half, patience and understanding can easily get tested to extremes when doing so.</p><p>Making a partner at this stage of life could add more to Basham's plate. There are year-round demands on a player's time - from never-ending training sessions to spring football to preseason and finally pre-season games, there are very few windows during the season when an NFL player or even a rookie isn't busy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie, Travis Etienne Net Worth, Career, Personal Life</strong></a></p><h2>Carlos Basham Career&nbsp;</h2><p>As a senior high schooler in Northside in Roanoke, Virginia, Basham had 76 tackles and seven sacks.
