I couldn’t think of a better way to spend my 31st birthday,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Teen Mom OG&nbsp;</i></a>alum, 31, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Saturday, March 5. “Each one of my kids have continued to push me into making me a better man, so I know you’re gonna do the same&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>Throughout the years the satisfaction I get from raising my two lil girls is unmatched.”</p><p class=p1>He continued in his post: “The joy that they bring me, the excitement is unmatched. I truthfully feel like God has put me in a position that I’m so lucky & blessed to be in. As a kid my dad wasn’t able to be around, and I feel like that’s why I try and give you girls EVERYTHING that I have. I can’t wait to watch you grow with your sisters Ryder & Mila&nbsp;<span class=s1>🌸🌻</span>&nbsp;I’m telling you right now both those girls love you so much.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Challenge&nbsp;</i></a>alum — who met Selfridge, 27, in November 2017 — concluded his note with a sweet message to his partner.</p><p>“Taylor, I don’t know too many people to put up with me for as long as you have&nbsp;<span class=s1>😂</span>&nbsp;but no seriously, I love you bby & I can’t wait to start this adventure with you and continue to build this family up,” Wharton added in his social media upload.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I also wanna say thank you to my support system those ppl know who you are just know I love you all and I appreciate it everything you do for me&nbsp;<span class=s1>🙏🏽</span>.”</p><p class=p1>The Oregon native <a href=#>shared the same maternity portraits</a> via her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page, gushing over her “new little peanut” and their growing brood.</p><p class=p1>“My whole life I knew I was meant to be a mother, I love my babies more than anything in this world,” Selfridge wrote on Saturday. “My heart grew twice the size and I knew I’d love you just the same as your sisters. I can’t wait to see your little face (even though you’ll look nothing like me & only daddy)&nbsp;<span class=s1>😂</span>.”</p><p class=p1>The Michigan native — who shares eldest daughter <a href=#>Ryder,</a> 4, with ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Cheyenne Floyd</strong> </a>— welcomed <a href=#>his second little girl with Selfridge in April 2020</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It was definitely a surprise,” Wharton <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;of Selfridge’s pregnancy in October 2019</a>. “Just being there from the day she found out that she’s pregnant and knowing that it was mine, I knew that I was going to have to step up. It’s exciting for me. It’s gonna be a lot, but I’m excited.”</p><p class=p1>After becoming a father of two — and <a href=#>balancing coparenting duties</a> with Floyd, 29 — Wharton struggled being away from his brood while filming&nbsp;<i>The Challenge: Spies, Lies and Allies.&nbsp;</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>It was hard mentally, just because the people at home were kind of struggling. Cheyenne was pregnant, Ryder was acting up. Taylor was missing me, and I <a href=#>missed Mila’s first steps</a>,” Wharton <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in July 2021</a>. “So, I’m missing crucial points in my child’s life that, like, I’ll never be able to get back. So that’s kind of hard to swallow. … When I do come home after doing a&nbsp;<i>Challenge</i>, I get to spend all my time with my kids. So that’s kinda how I rationalize it. This one was rough. I’m not gonna lie. This one was real tough. I missed my kids.”</p><p>Scroll below to see the couple’s pregnancy announcement photos:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZquVobOztcOgnGaho2K9s7HGp5inrF2axbGxwq2gp59dZ7ulecKhoKWcXay2tbSMnKarsV2staK%2B06ilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taralee-heaton-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-167037-html.html><span>←</span><span>Taralee Heaton Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
