She served the community with bravery and dedication, leaving an indelible mark on the department that will last for generations. Both her leadership and her dedication to the protection of the public will be remembered.</p><p>Roscoe residents are in mourning over the passing of a well-respected law enforcement officer. During this trying time, we want Chief Evan’s family and coworkers to know that our thoughts and condolences are directed toward them.</p><p>On December 8, 2023, Jamie passed away after a struggle against cancer that lasted for a very long time. After receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2008, she had therapy for a period of one and a half years.</p><p>On April 1, 2023, Evans made an official announcement that he would be retiring, citing concerns about his health. The decision to quit will be a difficult one.</p><p>On the occasion of her retirement, she expressed her sentiments by saying, “I have loved every minute of my law enforcement career, especially as a detective and as a chief.”</p><p>After beginning her career in law enforcement with the Village 25 years ago, Chief Evans has been in control of the department for the past 14 years. She began her career of law enforcement with the Village. Everyone who knew her has been taken aback by her unexpected passing.</p><p>Jamie held the position of Roscoe’s police chief from the year 2008 to the year 2022. Roscoe Police Department underwent a metamorphosis into a state-of-the-art law enforcement agency under the leadership of Chief Evans.</p><p>Chief Evans was responsible for overseeing the construction of a new police department in 2018, as well as the upgrading of the department fleet and, more recently, the process of achieving Tier One recognition via the Illinois Law Enforcement Accreditation Program. All of these things were done in order to reach this goal.</p><p>Because it has received accreditation, the Roscoe Police Department is considered to be one of the greatest departments in the state of Illinois.</p><p>The health problems that Evans was experiencing forced her to cut short her career as a law enforcement officer; nonetheless, she continued to devote her excitement and dedication to the community to a variety of organizations and charities that were working to raise awareness about cancer.</p><p>More than twenty-four years ago, Chief Jamie Evans began her career in law enforcement by joining the Roscoe Police Department.</p><p>During that time period, she was one of the two female personnel working for the department, and she was employed by Chief Dick Lee.</p><p>The fact that she started her career as a 911 operator in Ogle County when she was 19 years old laid the groundwork for her eventual position as the Chief of Police in Roscoe.</p><p>It was after she had been working as a dispatcher for two years that she learned that the Roscoe Police Department was looking for new employees.</p><p>After she submitted her application, she was selected for the position. When asked about it in an interview, she stated, “At first, my parents were not happy about it.”</p><p>Following the acceptance of her application, she attended the police academy for a period of three months to receive training before coming back to Roscoe to begin her career as a patrolman.</p><p>Over the course of her career, she gained experience in each and every department as she worked. She worked her way up to the rank of detective and eventually sergeant.</p><p>The previous Village President, Dave Krienke, selected Evans to serve as Chief of Police in 2008. Evans was the first female police officer to be appointed to the position in either Winnebago County or Boone County.</p><p>Her management and leadership have been instrumental in the Roscoe Police Department’s evolution into a state-of-the-art law enforcement institution. Now, there are fifteen police working for the department.</p><p>She oversaw the challenging process of obtaining Tier One accreditation through the Illinois Law Enforcement Accreditation Program (ILEAP), which is the state’s gold standard for law enforcement units, and she expanded and updated the fleet of patrol cars.</p><p>These are just some of the accomplishments that she has accomplished. Evans was the driving force behind the campaign to construct the brand-new police department building in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2ealrqqsYyerZqmo2K8o7XTrpirsV2ZsqLAx2alnq%2BjYr%2Bwv8KonGaon6G2pLGMnJ%2BinZZit6K5yJ5knq6Ro8BuvMCsqp6rXZbEosWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candidates-who-could-replace-trevor-noah-on-the-daily-show.html><span>←</span><span>Could These Stars Replace Trevor Noah On The Daily Show?</span></a>
