The New Zealand-born filmmaker is currently dating British musician Rita Ora, and had previously been <a href=#>said to have had a fling with Tessa Thompson</a>, who he worked with in Thor.</p><p>Another reason for Waititi’s recent spell in the spotlight has been the overwhelmingly positive reception of <a href=#>his period romantic comedy series</a>Our Flag Means Death on HBO Max.</p><p>The ten episodes of the show’s inaugural season were released on the platform in March this year. Following rave reviews from fans and critics alike, Our Flag was officially renewed for a second season in June.</p><p>As well as directing the first episode, Waititi is also one of the main stars. Here is what he – and some of his other castmates – have said about working on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Our Flag Means Death Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=rhys-darby-loves-working-with-his-co-stars-in-our-flag-means-death><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rhys Darby Loves Working With His Co-Stars In Our Flag Means Death</span></h2><p>Rhys Darby is Taika Waititi’s countryman, and they play rivals, turned pirate colleagues, turned friends, turned lovers in this mostly fictional story. Their characters – Stede Bonnet and Edward “Ed” Teach / Blackbeard respectively – are actual historical figures.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darby discussed the show</a> with Collider earlier this year, and revealed just how much his co-stars mean to him, saying: “I really adore all of them!”</p><h2 id=our-flag-means-death-is-ldquo-the-most-fun-con-o-rsquo-neill-has-ever-had-rdquo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Our Flag Means Death Is “The Most Fun Con O’Neill Has Ever Had”</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>English actor Con O’Neill plays Israel "Izzy" Hands, Blackbeard’s trusted number two. The character is also based on an actual pirate from history. Before the show premiered on HBO Max in March, he shared a trailer on his Twitter profile.</p><p>O’Neill accompanied the trailer with a caption that read: “Ok peeps here [is] the new trailer for ‘Our Flag Means Death’. It's the most fun I've ever had with my clothes on... or off.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Rhys Darby Before 'Our Flag Means Death'?</a></span></p><h2 id=samba-schutte-joined-the-cast-to-work-with-rhys-darby><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Samba Schutte Joined The Cast To Work With Rhys Darby</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Samba Schutte features in Our Flag as one of Stede Bonnet’s salaried pirate crew members. The Mauritanian-born Dutch actor was a massive fan of Rhys Darby before the show, and he was determined to land a part in it once he knew the Yes Man actor would be one of the main stars.</p><p>“When I saw that [Rhys was] gonna be involved in something I was like, ‘I need to be a part of this. I need to be part of this,’” he told Nerds and Beyond while discussing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his role in Our Flag</a>.</p><h2 id=vico-ortiz-is-proud-to-be-part-of-the-cast><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Vico Ortiz Is Proud To Be Part Of The Cast</span></h2><p>Vico Ortiz features in Our Flag as a non-binary character called Jim Jimenez.

In Our Flag, his character is called Wee John Feeney, yet another one of Stede’s crew members.</p><p>When HBO Max confirmed that there would be a second season of the show, Nairn wrote on Instagram: “I’m sure most of you have seen the wonderful news by now!
