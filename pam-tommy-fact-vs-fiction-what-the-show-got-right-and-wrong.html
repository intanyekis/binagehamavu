The story of how <strong>Rand Gauthier</strong> (<a href=#><strong>Seth Rogen</strong></a>) stole the infamous Hi8 video is full of wild twists and turns, but creator <strong>Robert Siegel</strong> did his best to maintain factual accuracy.</p><p>“We didn’t make up a whole lot,” the Wrestler screenwriter, 50, told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in January. “Most of what you see in those eight episodes is in that article. The basic plot beats are all straight from the article.”</p><p>Siegel was referring to the facts set forth in a 2014 <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> article “Pam and Tommy: The Untold Story of the World’s Most Infamous Sex Tape,” written by <strong>Amanda Chicago Lewis</strong>. The piece served as the main inspiration for the Hulu series, down to the detail that Gauthier had an interest in religion.</p><p>Anderson, 54, and Lee, 59, <a href=#>didn’t participate in the show</a>, but their portrayers both emphasized <a href=#>the importance of staying as true to life</a> as they could.</p><p>“It’s always such a huge responsibility to play someone, a real person,” James, 32, told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in March. “Particularly with Pam, she’s such an icon, I really love her, and <a href=#>I wanted to try and do her justice</a> and try and capture her spirit and really explore what happened at that time and how she was treated and how things have changed, or not changed.”</p><p>For his part, Stan, 39, really learned to play the drums so he could better embody one of rock’s most famous percussionists.</p><p>“I don’t play any musical instruments,” the Marvel star told <a href=#>ET</a>. “So, just kind of going at it and learning from scratch was pretty terrifying. I guess he was labelled as the greatest drummer in the world, so it just felt like they were big shoes to fill. But I did my best.”</p><p>While much of the show stayed true to real life, there was one scene in particular that was a total fabrication: the one where Mötley Crüe loses their studio to Third Eye Blind.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Mötley Crüe and I’ve never been in the same studio,” Third Eye Blind frontman <strong>Stephan Jenkins</strong> told <a href=#>Variety</a> in February. “I had never, in fact, listened to Mötley Crüe. I never even heard them. I actually saw Tommy Lee’s penis before I ever heard their band. I was like, ‘Well, good on ya, Tommy. Well done, lad.’ I literally had never heard them. But I somehow saw the sex tape.”</p><p>All eight episodes of Pam & Tommy are streaming on Hulu.
