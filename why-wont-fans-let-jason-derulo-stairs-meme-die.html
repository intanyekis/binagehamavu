But it did take a while before anyone decided to attach Jason's name to the spoofed pic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears Fans Have An Amazing Alternative To That Justin Timberlake Meme</a></span></p><p>In 2015, people started suggesting that it was Jason in the photo, incorrectly attributing the image to the 2015 Met Gala. One single Tweet got the ball rolling, setting off a meme chain that doesn't seem to have stopped since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-s-really-in-the-jason-derulo-stairs-meme>Who's Really In The Jason Derulo Stairs Meme?</h2><p>Onlookers (well, Twitter users at least) swear it was Jason who fell, but in reality, it was some unnamed person who was accused of "rushing" the red carpet. It appeared that the random man in a white suit had broken into the Cannes festival and wasn't really supposed to be there.</p><p>He wasn't someone famous -- and he doesn't even have the same skin tone as Jason Derulo to begin with.</p><p>The light-skinned man, who happened to have dark hair, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly tackled by someone in a black suit</a> as he came down the stairs at Cannes. What's most interesting about the original picture is that Jason wasn't even&nbsp;at the Met Gala in 2015 -- and he apparently wasn't at Cannes in 2011, either.</p><h2 id=why-won-t-fans-let-the-jason-derulo-stairs-meme-go>Why Won't Fans Let The Jason Derulo Stairs Meme Go?</h2><p>The short answer as to why fans don't want to let the Jason Derulo meme die is that they're&nbsp;not fans. The people who love to circulate the meme, giving it new life each time, are typically critics of Derulo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of his music (and his TikTok videos) realize that the singer doesn't appeal to all audiences. And the meme continuing to circulate a full ten years after its first iteration is proof that some people just&nbsp;don't like&nbsp;him. Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the way he unceremoniously dumped his famous ex</a> is another reason why some fans don't love him anymore.</p><p>But some fans have shared the image to carry the joke onward. In fact, someone seems to re-share the image, with a new meme-y caption, every time there's an awards ceremony of any kind. "Jason Derulo falling down the stairs" has been circulated for the 2020 Golden Globes, the 2020 Emmys (which were, quite hilariously, broadcasted over Zoom), and more.</p><p>And part of the fun has been the puns fans came up with as captions; "Jason Derolled down the stairs" is a popular one.</p><p>Not that Jason really cares; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's too busy making mega-bucks on TikTok</a> to care about an old meme, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas Shares Meme Of His Hairstyles Over The Years</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLyvwIyfmKerXaGytXnJmqqopl2ZsrPBy6hkrKyRnr%2B0ecyepJ5llJ6ycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-chicks-laura-lynch-dies-at-65-after-head-on-car-collision.html><span>←</span><span>The Chicks' Laura Lynch Dies at 65 After Head-On Car Collision</span></a>
