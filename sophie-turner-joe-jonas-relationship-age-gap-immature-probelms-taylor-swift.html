Compared to Nick Jonas, 29, and Priyanka Chopra, 39, their relationship certainly attracts a lot less attention from the media. But fans are not totally sold on the married couple. Some have issues with their dynamic, others with <a href=#>the Game of Thrones actress' maturity</a>, while many are just generally confused about them being together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's the typical celebrity couple buzz — every pair will always be either too into each other, too private, too public, or too normal. In this case, fans have different opinions. From fan concerns like that one over the <a href=#>photo of Turner crying with her husband</a> to some insider tea, here are the things that make fans question the "perfect" match.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Jonas Reveals The Jonas Brothers' Breakup Hit Him 'Like A Tsunami'</a></span></p><h2 id=the-couple-breaking-up-a-day-before-their-wedding>The Couple Breaking Up A Day Before Their Wedding</h2><p>It's not that fans see the whole breakup-a-day-before-the-wedding as a red flag. It's just that supporters of the couple have always rooted for the two to "break the wheel and make it last." So fans were worried when they heard about the couple's Vegas wedding. A fan on Twitter wrote: "Vegas wedding at the age of 22. Well, this has all the makings of a 50-year-long marriage. Sorry, someone had to say it. But I'll be rooting for Sophie Turner to break the wheel, and make it last."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple decided to tie the knot in Las Vegas while they were there for the 2019 Billboard Music Awards. The wedding ceremony was officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator. It was held at A Little White Wedding Chapel. Weeks later, the two had their formal wedding in France. However, Turner admitted that Jonas had broken up with her a day before their Vegas elopement. Fans thought that was a little off. The X-Men star explained what really happened but some were still suspicious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was the worst day of our lives. For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, 'Never mind,'" Turner told UK's The Times. "I was going through this phase of being very mentally unwell. He was, like, 'I can’t be with you until you love yourself, I can’t see you love me more than you love yourself.' That was something, him doing that. I think he kind of saved my life, in a way." Honestly, we don't get why that would be off. If anything, that might just be the healthiest Hollywood breakup ever.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Sophie Turner's Life Since 'Dark Phoenix' Flopped</a></span></p><h2 id=sophie-turner-39-s-friendship-with-joe-jonas-39-ex-taylor-swift>Sophie Turner's Friendship With Joe Jonas' Ex Taylor Swift</h2><p>In April 2021, Turner shared on her Instagram Story that she was listening to Taylor Swift's re-recorded Mr. Perfectly Fine. The track is said to be about the Jonas Brothers frontman himself. He dated the 11-time Grammy winner, 31, for a few months in 2008 when they were both teenagers. Some fans think it's a bit shady. "[S]till cackling over sophie turner promoting a thirteen year old breakup song taylor swift wrote about how emotionally inept her now-husband is," one tweeted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But again, some fans just take it too far sometimes. In real life, the three are all on good terms. Swift was even spotted partying with the couple after her <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> gig on November 13, 2021. This Swiftie perfectly summed up their intertwined relationship in a tweet: "It’s funny that sophie turner is an avid swiftie and she doesn’t care that her husband is a subject of taylor’s two breakup songs SKSKSKSK." We're sure they all just laugh about it. Come on, Swift and Jonas were practically kids back then.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Joe Jonas Was Called Out By His First Lover</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-think-sophie-turner-39-acts-like-an-overgrown-child-39>Fans Think Sophie Turner 'Acts Like An Overgrown Child'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p>In the last few years, people have been extremely sensitive about age gaps in Hollywood. So much so that the mere 7-year difference between Turner and Jonas is considered "weird." But fans argue that the Josie actress getting married at 22 was a little premature. "I loved Sophie as Sansa on Game of Thrones but I find her to be very immature in behavior," a Redditor said. "And yes, I know she's married and just had a baby, but that still doesn't make someone mature. She acts like an overgrown child."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan on Reddit cited Jonas' dating history for further context: "Wasn't joe jonas the one who tried to flirt with gigi [Hadid] when she was super young?" Someone replied, saying that "he's dated like all the best friends of his ex girlfriends." But such assumptions aside, many fans actually think the couple are "truly class acts" who are so cool for keeping their relationship private, unlike Nick and Priyanka... Now, that's a couple that gets a lot of hate.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Amazon's 'The Wheel Of Time' Is Said To Be The Next 'Game Of Thrones', Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKiYnrJuwNSrpZ6qXZ%2B8pnnJqKWaq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1urcaeZKCZoGK2rrnArayrnV2lv7CuxKWkrGWklsatu9FmqrChlql8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./troy-bergeron.html><span>←</span><span>Troy Bergeron Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</span></a>
