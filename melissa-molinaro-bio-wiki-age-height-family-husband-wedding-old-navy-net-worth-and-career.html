In 2002, she appeared in ‘High Crimes’, ‘Prep’, and ‘Journey of Redemption.’ In addition, she also had roles in ‘Grounded for Life’, ‘Destiny’s Child’, and ‘Happy Family.’ In 2004, she played the role of JT’s Love Interest in the TV series ‘The Young and the Restless.’</p><p>Since then, she has appeared in several other movies and television series. All in all, she has over 20 credits as an actress. Furthermore, Melissa has also released the album titled ‘The Love/Dance Project’ and a compilation album, ‘Soul By The Pound.’</p><p>Some other movies and television series that Molinaro has appeared in include ‘Fixed’, ‘Hit the Floor’, ‘Street’, ‘Franklin & Bash’, ‘School Dance’, ‘Second Generation Wayans’, ‘Jersey Shore Shark Attack’, ‘The Game’, ‘Honey 2’, ‘Balls to the Wall’, ‘How I Met Your Mother’, ‘Brothers’, ‘Command Performance’, and ‘Rodney’ among others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=melissa-molinaro-old-navy></span><span>Melissa Molinaro Old Navy</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian won’t be blazing any new legal trails when it comes to the use of look-alike celebrities in advertisements.&nbsp;The socialite and reality TV star has settled a high-profile $20 million lawsuit against The Gap over an Old Navy TV commercial that featured a similar-looking brunette reality star named Melissa Molinaro.</p><p>Kardashian followed other famous people, including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Vanna White, and Bette Midler, in bringing a lawsuit against an advertiser for misappropriating her personality. This case, however, never reached any significant ruling before coming to a resolution.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=inside-kardashian-inc></span><span>Inside Kardashian Inc.</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>What the case did bring was a lot of personal drama. After the lawsuit was filed, attorneys for Old Navy parent The Gap were aggressive in the discovery phase, launching an investigation to see whether Kardashian’s reputation has been tarnished.</p><p>Around the time the Old Navy commercial was cast, Molinaro reportedly was dating one of Kardashian’s ex-boyfriends, football star Reggie Bush, who was one of the people The Gap wanted to depose.</p><p>The Gap also had sought information about why the clothing retailer Bebe decided to drop its Kardashian clothing line, financial records concerning Kardashian’s clothing deals and further information about “Kim Kardashian’s reputation as a singer and dancer.”</p><p>No trial will mean that The Gap won’t attempt to show that Kardashian couldn’t support her claims that the commercial damaged her brand value nor that Kardashian couldn’t sing and dance as well as Molinaro.</p><p>Instead, the lawsuit has been settled privately after the two sides engaged a mediator, Daniel Weinstein, who has experience resolving high-profile cases. Terms of the settlement aren’t yet known, but the Old Navy commercial in question appears to have been taken down from YouTube, surviving only in all the news reports on the subject.</p><h1 style=text-align:center><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Melissa Molinaro</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-melissa-molinaro></span><span><span>Who is Melissa Molinaro?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa Molinaro is a celebrated Pop Singer, Actress, Dancer, Choreographer, and Model, who is widely known for her appearance as a Contestant in the MTV reality television series ‘Making the Band 3’</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-melissa-molinaro></span><span><span>How old is Melissa Molinaro?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Molinaro is an American national born on 4th June 1982, in Whitby, Ontario.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-melissa-molinaro></span><span><span>How tall is Melissa Molinaro?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa stands at a height of 1.57m.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-melissa-molinaro-married></span><span><span>Is Melissa Molinaro married?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Molinaro is married to Bryan Kowalski.
