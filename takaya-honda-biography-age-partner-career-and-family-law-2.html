So it was challenging to find that balance.”</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-2 leader-2704 adtester-container adtester-container-704" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-2-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span></p><p>Trystan discovered the producers of the show were looking to cast someone for the series when his aunt saw the audition notice on social media. It was the first time he’d auditioned to work on a screen production.</p><p>“I had lots of call-backs and about four additional auditions. I worked with Takaya Honda and Anthony Brandon Wong to make sure we had the right chemistry.” he explained. In the series Wong plays his on-screen father Danny, while&nbsp;Neighbours&nbsp;star Honda plays handsome neighbour Klaus.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span></p><p>Filming the series sees Sydney based Trystan get to spend several months in Queensland while the production is being created, something which he sees as partly a holiday.</p><p>“It’s a bit like a holiday, you get to go and explore another city on the weekends, but I’m still in school so I also have lots of school work to fit in alongside filming, but they have tutors for me.”</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-3></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-3 leader-3710 adtester-container adtester-container-710" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-3><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-3-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span></p><p>Trystan said the show’s mix of themes relating to culture, race, age and sexuality was something that a lot of people could connect with.</p><p>“I’ve sort of been growing up with the fictional Ben, it’s been really interesting drawing parallels between us three.”</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span></p><p>Trystan notes that sometimes he’s more successful in real life than his onscreen counterpart. “In Season Two Ben was trying for student leadership but ended up running away from the microphone, but in real life I was successfully elected to being School Captain, so I guess the show taught me what-not-to-do.”</p><p>Last year Trystan also appeared in the sci-fi movie&nbsp;Occupation, and he’s currently filming it’s sequel. He’s also set to appear in the upcoming comedy drama series&nbsp;Frayed, but his next challenge is a stage role, his high school production of&nbsp;Fiddler on the Roof.</p><p><strong>The Family Law will return 12th January at 8.30pm on SBS and SBS VICELAND</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p>Adopted from:&nbsp;www.outinperth.com</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=takaya-honda-instagram></span>Takaya Honda Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><h2></h2><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyRoK66rYyhpqeckWKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjKmYq6yemr9ur8CrnJ6qXZa7pXnFmqSipKliuaLDjGtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./title-t-i-addresses-his-late-friend-peeing-on-drake-the-wildest-shit-ive-ever-seen-before.html><span>←</span><span>T.I.
