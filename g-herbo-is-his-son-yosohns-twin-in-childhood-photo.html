Me and her was having our differences but that was no excuse to cheat on her, that was not why I cheated on her. I didn’t intentionally do all that.”</p><p>He went on to clarify that the period of infidelity started shortly after the birth of Yohsohn. Ari has previously spoken about experiencing postpartum depression after his arrival in 2018.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>G Herbo admitted that part of the stress on the former couple’s relationship was his own lack of experience and knowledge about the mental health&nbsp; which, according to National Library of Medicine, can impact as many as 20 percent of new mothers within the first six weeks after childbirth.</p><p>“I was naïve to that though,” he explained. “I ain’t never been around a woman who was suffering from postpartum depression or none of that. And at the same time, when she was going through that, I had just lost one of my best friends, I lost my homie C Money. So I was super stressed and shit. But that ain’t no excuse, I ain’t making no excuse. I had to make peace with myself early on. Cuz I thought I was right back then.”</p><p><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>He continued: “We was at a space where we wasn’t communicating like that. We wasn’t having sex, I wasn’t coming home to my family, I’m sleeping in the studio every night. So in my brain, I’m like, ‘Aight, I ain’t cheating ’cause I’m not having sex with her and going and having sex with somebody else.’ But in actuality I was though.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mieZqCVp6%2BwecisZKGho2LAsLqMsqasp5ijwG7A1qKlZqGeYrCptcudn6inlGK9qbvTqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-credit-toby-keith-putting-taylor-swift-map-mourn-tragic-death.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Credit Toby Keith For Putting Taylor Swift On The Map As The Mourn His Tragic Death</span></a>
