And when streaming giant Hulu dropped the news about streaming the movie on Twitter, there was a massive response, but for the wrong reasons. The South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho was immediately met with a response from one who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>: "It’s not in English, no one wants to watch a movie that they literally have to read to understand what’s going on. Sound is such a huge part of movies and it being in a different language is so weird."</p><p>What followed was an epic troll reply from Hulu that also got Twitterati supporting the streaming network. The prompt response <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>: "If you don't want to read subtitles, you can always learn Korean!"</p><p>"I feel sorry for people like that. So ignorant of the best experiences in life," a fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>. "Imagine being so lazy to not read subtitles," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">retorted</a> another fan. This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reaction is</a> a bit bold: "DRAG THE RACISTS HULU!" And here's a more subtle response to the fan who was at the receiving end of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeting</a> at the wrong time: "It’s a Korean movie lol I don’t think Korea complains when we make movies in English."</p><p>"He can't read English or any other language, that's the problem," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> another. This was echoed by a fan who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>: "Imagine missing out on great cinema because you won't read and think another language is 'distracting noise'. Lol GTFO."</p><p>Well, here's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one</a> from someone who didn't mind watching the film in South Korean: "Mbuk kiro bahasa nang ndunyo iki enggres tok ngono a??" As far as mean tweets go, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> has probably got the fan irked: "Showing off your lack of intelligence is not cute."&nbsp;</p><p>'Parasite' follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. Apart from the Oscars, the film also bagged the Golden Globe Award for 'Best Foreign Language Film' and the BAFTA Award for 'Best Film Not in the English Language'. It&nbsp; also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for 'Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture'.</p><p>Guess somebody needs to tell these haters all this.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are wondering how to watch it with English and Spanish subtitles, Hulu tweeted out to its viewers how to go about it. "Are there Spanish subtitles? I want my mom to watch it," one viewer wondered. Hulu was quick to tweet back: "Hi there! Our version of Parasite will play with English-language subtitles built into the video, but Spanish-language subtitles are offered as an additional option for those viewers who prefer that experience. In other words, you can watch this film with both subtitles!"</p><p>Moreover, when a user wrote, "Help, there are no English Subtitles on the movie when I start watching. Only Spanish subs," they replied, "Oh no! English subtitles should appear when you click play without having to make a selection. If not, just reboot the device in use and try turning subtitles off and back on. For 1:1 assistance, please follow the prompts here: https://hulu.tv/ContactSupport- & pick 'I still need help'."</p><p>'Parasite' is available for streaming on Hulu.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooKWhwm68wKuYrKGkmnqlu8yaoKeXZmLAsa3RpKpmpZGowKrCxGaZpaenqr1ussCnqmadnpy5qr%2FHZqqumqSewa2x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gallery-sitemap.html><span>←</span><span>Winter Wonderland</span></a>
