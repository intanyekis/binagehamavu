The two pushed for swans, replanting the family’s yard and moving all the furniture out, all of which sent George through the roof.</p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>Twelve years after the film’s sequel brought to life the story of Annie and Nina being pregnant at the same time, some of the cast reunited in person, and fans couldn’t get enough of it.</p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>“Loved seeing my <a href=#>former costars @stevemartintogo & @themartinshort</a> at the Opryhouse tonight for their show in #Nashville,” Williams-Paisley wrote via Instagram in March 2017 alongside a photo of herself with her movie dad and go-to planner.</p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>Seven months later, Newbern teased the <a href=#>possibility of a third film from the cast</a>, telling Us Weekly exclusively in November 2017, “I know there’s a script out there and there’s talk.”</p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>At the time, the actor also revealed what he thought his character would be up to following his life as an independent communications consultant.<span class=x_x_apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>“I think Bryan MacKenzie would probably be a grandfather now. They had a kid, so he’s probably got a grandkid at this point, I think. Or at least close to it,” he told<span class=x_x_apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Us</i>. “Or his daughter would be getting married. He’s probably invested in a startup in the Silicon Valley because they are on the West Coast. And they probably live up in the Bay area. They got four kids. They need to shoot a third one. We need to do a third one. That would be great.”</p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>Three years later, Newbern’s third film theory <a href=#>was SORT OF confirmed</a> when Netflix announced in September 2020 that the cast was reuniting for a reunion movie titled&nbsp;<i>Father of the Bride Part 3 (Ish).</i></p><p class=x_x_xmsonormal>“Finally!
