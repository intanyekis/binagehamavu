However, we all have one thing in common: death. Like taxes, bad weather, and rush-hour traffic, death is unavoidable. When we think about death ourselves- as in our own death- it feels alien and unnatural. The death of someone close to us, say a friend or loved one, will make us feel sorrow and even put us in a state of depression.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the death of a celebrity, it's a mixed bag, however. Some may feel as though the loss of this famous individual is akin to the loss of someone they know. Others may not care that they died due to lack of interest or simply not liking them. So why is it that a celebrity's death may shock someone? It could be because of the amount of roles they played in their careers or even one role that's stuck with people. Maybe it's because they've been able to make someone laugh during a rough moment in their life. Or it might be because their death was so sudden that it made them realize how that person affected their lives.</p><p>From actors to actresses, to athletes, and musicians, these are 15 Celebs You Forgot Died In The 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dale-earnhardt-february-18th-2001><strong>Dale Earnhardt (February&nbsp;18th, 2001)</strong></h2><p>Dale Earnhardt was a major player in NASCAR, winning 76 Winston Cup races in his career.
