These ladies have such a huge project on the go.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TMZ</a> reports their residences are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truly mammoth-sized</a>, making this mother-daughter custom built property one (two?) of a kind. Each of the ladies is investing $10 million into creating their dream homes, and in doing so, they're ensuring they'll have the very best neighbors... one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Jenner Reveals What She Believes Is Her Most 'Priceless' Investment</a></span></p><p>Both Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner already have their own massive mansions, but living a stone's throw away from one another sounds oh-so-sweet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mother and daughter duo are finalizing the build of their huge custom homes, neighboring one another with very little space between each of their compounds.</p><p>Jenner first put the Kardashians on the map when her original villa-like Calabasas home became the set for their hit reality TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. T<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hat residence quickly became a familiar backdrop </a>for millions of fans across the globe that religiously tuned in to the show.</p><p>Kris Jenner has maintained that home and is showing no interest in letting it go. At this time, her son Rob Kardashian lives there with his daughter,&nbsp;Dream.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe is in the middle of her on-again, off-again relationship with Tristan Thompson,</a> and clearly had her family in mind when she decided to build this huge compound with her mother. Her residence is slightly larger than the one Kris Jenner built, allowing more room for her daughter, and Tristan as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Space isn't really a concern in either of these homes though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>reports that Khloe's home is "18,000 square feet and features 8 bedrooms and 9.5 bathrooms. There's also an 8-car garage, covered patios, guesthouse, movie theater and gym. Kris' place is a massive 17,000 square feet."</p><p>The ladies have built these enormous farmhouse styled homes in the area of Hidden Hills, and it has been reported that construction on this huge property began in 2020.</p><p>By the looks of the progress that is being made on the land, it seems that the plans are nearly complete on the actual structure of the homes, but there are a series of workers that remain on hand to complete the final touches. It's likely that landscapers will be brought in soon to manicure the massive land that this residence sits on, as the exterior remains in skeletal form at this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Kris and Khloe are able to move in to their shared property, they will also be very close to Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, each of whom also owns land in the immediate area.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Jenner Hits 40 Million Instagram Followers, How It Affects Her Revenue</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, TMZ</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4s7XSZqGepp6av263x6WmnmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXaKur7%2FIqKWsZaOesaZ5wbJkrKGUmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-the-dark-suicidal-world-of-professional-wrestling.html><span>←</span><span>Inside the dark, suicidal world of professional wrestling</span></a>
