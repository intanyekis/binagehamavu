The <a href=#>conservatorship </a>was granted to her paternal guardian in 2007 after a series of explosive and volatile episodes back in 2007 which also resulted in her losing custody over her two children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the last court hearing in September 2021 where Britney demanded to be released from her father's personal and financial affairs. Her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, is also facing the wrath of the Oops...I Did It Again singer and songwriter, for threatening to release a book revealing a behind-the-scenes look into Britney's personal dilemmas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family feud has only seemed to escalate in recent times, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that in the build-up to her court hearing on Wednesday 19, 2022, Britney accused her sister, <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears</a>, of supplying their father with millions of dollars of her money for personal affairs while she was under their conservatorship for over 13 years. What was once a loving sisterhood between the two has become a vicious social media frenzy. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC News</a> article disclosed that Britney threatened to sue her sister if she persists in making "derogatory" statements about her while promoting her new book entitled, Things I Should Have Said.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Getting Hitched: Britney Spears Flaunts Her Sparkling Diamond And Announces Engagement With Sam Asghari</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney's lawyer, Matthew Rosengart, warned in a cease and desist letter to <a href=#>Jamie Lynn</a> that it is "potentially unlawful and defamatory" to use "false and fantastical grievances...especially when designed to sell books." He has also filed a series of legal documents accusing Spears' father, Jamie Spears, of engaging in "financial and business mismanagement" and "abusive and bullying conduct toward his daughter." The files also claimed that Jamie was <a href=#>unable to serve his conservatorship</a> faithfully as he was compromised due to chronic alcohol abuse.</p><p>The reports further claim that the $6 million Jamie received while Britney was under his conservatorship went to private endeavors, such as an idea for a show called "Cookin' Cruzin' & Chaos," in which he transformed one of Britney's tour buses into a food truck. But the worst of the damage isn't done. Rosengart found that another $30 million, which was court-approved, was spent by Jamie Spears on lawyers and legal fees to prolong the conservatorship. With parental issues such as these, it's no wonder Britney was so eager to be <a href=#>engaged to her new lover, Sam Asghari.</a> This is far from over, so stay tuned!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Eyeing The Exit?
