They not only offer noise-canceling features but also incorporate the best technology for better amplification. Headphones come in different shapes and sizes. Their prices differ according to the quality and technology used in the models. Headphones can start from $30 and range as high as $100,000. <a href=#>It depends on the buyers</a> and their interests to spend their savings buying the most exclusive and premium quality headphones for a hefty price. While regular headphones offer quality and sound, some headphones take things to the next level.</p><p>From better-looking chassis, encrusted jewelry to clearer and clever sound, headphones offer the most extravagant features to their customers for a high price range. While some of the models are limited edition or can be bought on retail, the headphones get more customized as the list goes on. Let’s take a look at the most expensive headphones in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=astell-amp-kern-layla-aion>Astell & Kern Layla AION</h2><p>While expensive headphones are expected to be over-the-ear models, Astell & Kern’s Layla AION in-ear headphones are a hit with music and game lovers. First released as customized models in 2014, they were later released in two limited editions: Full Metal Jacket and Carbon Fiber Edition. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Audio</a>, AION comes with a 12-driver configuration with Astell & Kern’s patented Freqphase technology and costs $3,299.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Top 10 Headphones In The Apple Store</a></span></p><h2 id=audeze-lcd-4z>Audeze LCD-4z</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Audeze has an exciting LCD lineup that contains customer favorites such as LCD-1, LCD MX4, and LCD XC. Carrying the $3,995 price tag, LCD-4z stands apart from its lineup. The new flagship set comes with highly efficient double Fluxor magnetic arrays, thin nano-grade diaphragm, and cast magnesium housing giving it a lighter weight. <a href=#>The headphones</a> don’t need an amplifier and can be connected straight to the device from the AUX port.</p><h2 id=stax-sr-009>Stax SR-009</h2><p>Stax does not need to design flashy headphones to justify the $4,450 price tag. The SR-009 is the most sophisticated and classy-looking pair of headphones that come in a simple design. For a subtle look, Stax created them with a white coat, a copper wire in the cable, and an ultra-thin diaphragm.</p><h2 id=abyss-ab-1266>Abyss AB-1266</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abyss is <a href=#>considered a niche brand</a>, not quite popular however they offer good design properties for their headphones. The AB-1266 is aesthetically pleasing and contains planar magnetic drivers for better sound quality, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>. The headphones have a starting price of $5,495, and while they may not be the first choice, they can be a preferred model if seeking a change.</p><h2 id=ultrasone-ed5-ltd-edition-5>Ultrasone ED5 LTD Edition 5</h2><p>Ultrasone’s Edition 5 is the premier set of headphones that is the best solution to up the audio game. Known to produce good sound and proper stereo separation, the ED5 limited edition is a rare piece to find. Costing $5,000, the model offers an unboxing experience as it comes in a beautiful brown leather box with a microfiber cloth to keep the model clean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=warwick-acoustics-sonoma-model-one>Warwick Acoustics Sonoma Model One</h2><p>While Sonoma One may not be the most attractive-looking model, Warwick Acoustics makes up for it with addicting sound quality. Costing close to $6,800, the package comes with open-backed headphones and an energizer amplifier for high voltage usage. <a href=#>The headphones</a> are made from Nylon 12 polymer and offer clear and stunning sound.</p><h2 id=v-moda-crossfade-m-100>V-Moda Crossfade M-100</h2><p>A cash load of $40,000 can buy a lot of things, and the V-Moda Crossfade M-100 is undoubtedly one of them. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Engadget</a>, the priciest feature of the headphones is the customized decorative shields that are located on the sides. They are 3-D printed based on the metal chosen by the customer between gold, silver, bronze, and platinum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sennheiser-orpheus-he-1>Sennheiser Orpheus HE 1</h2><p>The third most expensive on the list are made by Sennheiser, called the HE 1, costing $68,000. The HE 1s aren’t the kind of headphones that can be worn every day as they come with a separate kit that contains its separate valve amp, which is required for them to work correctly. The headphones are made from microfiber, sculpted aluminum, and leather.</p><h2 id=onkyo-h900m>Onkyo H900M</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CES Las Vegas was lit up when Onkyo took center stage to introduce the H900M with 20-carat diamonds positioned on the earcups. <a href=#>These stunning diamonds</a> are embedded on aluminum plates that are attached to the stainless steel ring. The $100,000 headphones found a unique way to distinguish the right and left earcups. The left earcup is embedded with a single ruby, while the right one has two rubies.</p><h2 id=focal-utopia-by-tournaire>Focal Utopia by Tournaire</h2><p>Unveiled in 2016 at the Tournaire Boutique in Paris, Focal Utopia remains the most expensive headphone globally. Made by jeweler Tournaire, the headphones contain 18-carat gold and a trilogy of diamonds perched on the headband, which are handcrafted by the jeweler himself, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Hi-Fi</a>. Given their $120,000 price, the headphones are not mass-produced, and customers need to pre-order to get their hands on this expensive piece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the other expensive headphones include Final Audio Design Sonorous X, HiFiMan HE1000 V2, and Shure KSE1500. While top brands like Sennheiser and Warwick Acoustics have offered <a href=#>expensive products</a>, jewelers such as Tournaire haven’t backed out on adding their touch to the best headphones. As the interest in headphones has increased with gamers and audio listeners, more interesting headphones will be released sooner or later.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Products By Samsung</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Audio</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Engadget</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Hi-Fi</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Sxp56mo57DpnnBnpitq11mfW65zqyrZp2opbKvv8ivnGaglZaxsbTOp5ysZZmjerW0xGauqKqcmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./blac-chyna-denies-lying-harvard-business-school-648646.html><span>Blac Chyna Denies Lying About Harvard Enrollment: Watch</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
