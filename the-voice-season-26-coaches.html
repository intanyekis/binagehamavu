Below, we have everything to know about the The Voice‘s Season 26 coaching panel, including <a href=# rel=noopener>which coaches are leaving and who is coming back</a>.</p><h2>Who are The Voice coaches for Season 26?</h2><p>The 25th season of NBC’s The Voice kicked off on Feb. 26, 2024, with returning coaches John Legend and Reba McEntire, Season 23 coach Chance The Rapper and newcomers Dan + Shay, who were the show’s first-ever coaching duo. Before McEntire and singer Asher HaVon were even crowned the Season 25 champs, the coaches for Season 26 were revealed.</p><p>Of the four (technically five) Season 25 coaches, only McEntire is returning. She will be joined by alum Gwen Stefani, who is coming back for her eighth non-consecutive season, and two newcomers: Snoop Dogg and Michael Bublé. Although this will be the first season for Snoop Dogg and Bublé, both artists are already familiar with the show. The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper previously served as Season 20’s Mega Mentor, while Bublè was a team advisor for nine-time winning coach Blake Shelton during Season 3. The latter is clearly feeling confident about his chances of winning the season, as he’s already added the title “Future Winner of @NBCTheVoice” to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram bio</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> See which celebrities will join The Voice as coaches next</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Season-26-coaches.jpg alt="The Voice Season 26 Coaches" width=1383 height=807 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Legend, who is exiting the show to focus on his upcoming tour An Evening With John Legend, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> ahead of the Season 25 finale that he is excited about Bublé and Snoop Dogg joining the show full time. “It’s exciting to incorporate some new people into The Voice family,” he said, adding: “Having Snoop here, he’s been here as a mentor before, but having him as a coach, I think is going to be a lot of fun and reinvigorate the show a bit … We’ve been around for 25 seasons and part of how we continue to stay fresh is introducing new coaches to The Voice&nbsp;family, and I think Michael and Snoop will do really well. And I’m excited that Gwen and Reba will be back too because they’re both wonderful coaches.”</p><p>The “All of Me” singer also hinted that he’s not leaving The Voice for good. “I’ll be back … If only I were actually going to take a break!” he teased.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> See which coach has won the most seasons of The Voice&nbsp;</a></p><p>Shortly after the Season 26 coaching panel was announced, Snoop Dogg appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and talked about his latest career endeavor. “Well, if you know anything about me, you know I love all forms of music,” he told Fallon. “So this is a great opportunity for me to show that I really understand music, and to be a real coach and to really give direction to some of these artists that could be, you know, today’s next big thing.” When asked if he liked country music, Snoop Dogg responded: “I love all forms of music — that’s what people are going to learn about me … I’m the people’s champ!”</p><p>Back in 2021, Snoop Dogg discussed whether he would join the show as a coach following his appearance as a Mega Mentor. “The bag gotta be right first and foremost. It’s gotta be fun and involve funds, f-u-n-d-s,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ExtraTV</a>, noting that he enjoyed working with Season 20 coaches Shelton, Legend, Kelly Clarkson and Nick Jonas. “Being able to work with them is always a great experience and then also to be able to give some information to artists who they were actually coaching, so that way when they do get their break, whether it’s through the show or not, they’re gonna be really ready to go.”</p><p>The Voice is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on The Voice, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>the best and worst winners</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2aFdYSOrZ%2BeZaaktqSxjKycmqufo3pzgoycppqbmJrAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./naturi-naughton-engaged-child-fiance-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Neil Lane diamond ring for Naturi Naughton!
