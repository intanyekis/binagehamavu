Since then, the films found box office success, <a href=#>with the fourth installment set to debut in theaters</a> on Friday, March 24.</p><p>Before John Wick: Chapter 4‘s release, Reeves <a href=#>reflected on returning to play the fictional assassin</a>. “It’s a fun character to be able to have that John Wick kind of thing. But I don’t take that home with me,” he told Good Morning America on Monday, March 20, during an interview that was filmed days<a href=#> before his costar Lance Reddick passed away at age 60 from natural causes.</a></p><p>The Canada native <a href=#>broke down the intense workout regimen</a> that goes into bringing John Wick to life. “[It] starts with training before the training,” he shared about the onscreen mix of judo, jiu-jitsu and weapons manipulation. “I’m not quite [in the aging out stage] yet. [But this franchise] got me closer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Keanu-Reeves-Loves-How-%E2%80%98John-Wick-Franchise-Keeps-Him-in-%E2%80%98Top-Physical-Shape-The-Films-Regimen-Keeps-Him-on-His-Toes-045.jpg><p>Reeves continued: “I’m definitely feeling the age. … I mean, I think the film is really epic, and I love playing the role. I love the John Wick world.”</p><p>As the Speed actor continues to promote a new installment of John Wick, the insider <a href=#>praised Reeves for being “the sweetest guy” to his fans</a> over the years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He treats everyone with the same amount of respect, and he does get joy out of every interaction,” the source continued. “Keanu would much rather attend a huge fan event than go on a press circuit. He very much enjoys his privacy.”</p><p>For more details on the work Reeves puts in for the John Wick franchise, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly — on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnq5mZsm63xJqlrmWimrK3sdJmmqilnZ7BrrHNrWStp12pvLF5z6GwrKGTlrluv8eap55llqS%2FbrbOoaVmr5mYuHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-did-michael-b-jordan-make-from-rum-brand-cultural-appropriation.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Did Michael B.
